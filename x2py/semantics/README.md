# Semantics Package

This package owns the language-neutral contract between native parser facts,
editable `.pyi` files, readiness diagnostics, and wrapper code generation.

## Entry Points

| File | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `models.py` | Semantic IR dataclasses and metadata keys. |
| `fortran2ir.py` | Fortran parser facts to semantic modules. |
| `c2ir.py` | C parser facts to semantic modules. |
| `pyi_parser.py` | Minimal `.pyi` text/file parsing to Python AST. |
| `pyi2ir.py` | User-editable semantic `.pyi` AST conversion and validation. |
| `native_contract.py` | Source-free native ABI and placement validation. |
| `policy_completion.py` | Complete ownership, transfer, destruction, mutability/writeback, projection, nullability, release, storage, Python-barrier, native-barrier, and accessor decisions after full signatures are known. |
| `readiness.py` | Support blockers and readiness reports before wrapper codegen. |
| `ir2ast.py` | Semantic IR to codegen AST lowering for wrapper generation; consumes completed policies. |

## Pipeline Position

```text
C parser facts, Fortran parser facts, or parsed .pyi AST
  -> semantic modules
  -> semantic policy completion
       -> complete storage, Python-barrier, and native-barrier policy
  -> readiness blockers or codegen AST
```

`ir2ast.py` is the boundary where semantic contracts become generated-wrapper
implementation details. Object kind, ownership, transfer, destruction,
mutability/writeback, result projection, nullability, release responsibility,
contract/boundary storage modes, Python-barrier action, and native-barrier
action must be completed before this boundary by `policy_completion.py` using
`x2py/ownership_policy.py`. Getter result, native setter assignment, and Python
setter exposure policies are completed there as well.

The Python barrier and native barrier are separate policy decisions. The Python
barrier says how the generated CPython extension extracts or validates the
Python object: Python scalar value, rank-0 NumPy scalar storage, NumPy array
storage, Python string value, raw address value, or generated wrapper instance.
The native barrier says how the bridge presents the extracted value to native
code: direct value, call-local address, caller/Python-backed storage address,
raw address, packed array descriptor, or wrapper-owned native address.

Policy completion also validates the boundary spelling. Callable `Addr(T)` is
an integer raw-address contract and is limited to primitive scalars,
fixed-length strings, and primitive arrays with fully resolved extents.
`Addr(Arg(i))` is limited to primitive scalar values that need call-local
addressing. Arrays, strings, rank-zero storage, wrapped objects, and raw-address
arguments use `Arg(i)` because their default native representation is already
address- or handle-based.

`readiness.py`, `ir2ast.py`, bridges, and bindings consume those decisions
instead of making local policy guesses. Bridge and binding dispatch is strict:
an unregistered barrier action or object-kind/action pair is an error rather
than a fallback. Model-node dispatch uses `x2py.visitor.ClassVisitor` and the
`_visit_<ClassName>` protocol across parser-model conversion, `.pyi` AST
conversion, semantic lowering, bridges, bindings, and printers. Barrier/action
dispatch tables are separate and must not be used as model-node visitors.

The CLI source inspection path keeps parser and converter selection compact in
`x2py/cli.py` through `_SOURCE_SEMANTIC_PIPELINES[language]`. Each table entry
selects the language parser and parser-to-IR converter; semantic policy
completion remains the next shared stage after those converters produce
`SemanticModule` objects.
