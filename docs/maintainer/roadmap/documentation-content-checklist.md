# Documentation Content Checklist

This checklist tracks documentation pages that exist but are still placeholders,
thin drafts, or missing evidence. It is not an implementation checklist. Use
[Semantic `.pyi` Wrapper Checklist](semantic-pyi-wrapper-checklist.md) for
runtime parity, policy, and wrapper implementation work.

A page is complete only when it gives readers the information they need without
relying on private conversation or implied project knowledge.

## Completion Rule

Move an item from the open queue to completed content evidence only when all of
these are true:

- [ ] The page status is accurate: `maintained` for current public behavior,
  `design` for accepted architecture, or `not-yet-implemented` for explicit
  future behavior.
- [ ] The page explains what is supported now, what is unsupported, and where to
  find the supporting tests, fixtures, examples, or source owner.
- [ ] User-facing pages include a task-oriented workflow, expected output or API
  shape, limitations, and troubleshooting links.
- [ ] Developer-facing pages include ownership boundaries, source routes,
  focused verification commands, and rules for updating related docs.
- [ ] Examples are either executable documentation examples, checked fixtures,
  or clearly labeled illustrative snippets.
- [ ] Reuse earlier examples by reference instead of reprinting them, unless the
  page must be self-contained for a first-time user task.
- [ ] User-facing examples use clean copyable filenames and module names; keep
  fixture-style names such as parser/test abbreviations out of beginner docs.
- [ ] Documentation-only changes use focused docs checks and `git diff --check`;
  reserve the full static-analysis suite for code, tests, build/tooling changes,
  or explicit pre-merge verification.
- [ ] User, Developer, and Maintainer lane entry points, `mkdocs.yml`, related
  front matter, and `tests/tools/test_documentation_structure.py` stay
  synchronized.

## Open Documentation Queue

Only unfinished documentation content belongs here. When a page is filled, move
the item to completed content evidence and update the page status in the same
change.

The queue is ordered by execution priority and dependency. Complete current
user workflows and their supporting references first. Leave larger example
investments and site-publication decisions until the underlying content is
stable. Within each section, work from foundational pages toward dependent or
more specialized pages.
