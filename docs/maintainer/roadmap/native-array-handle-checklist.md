# Native Array Handle Checklist

This is the implementation and verification checklist for native Fortran array
descriptor handles:

- `Allocatable[T[...]]`
- `Pointer[T[...]]`

Use this page as the canonical checklist for this feature. The original prompts
are consolidated here; future implementation should use this page instead of
re-reading those prompts.

The intended implementation is one shared native-array handle path with
descriptor-specific operations layered on top. Keep Allocatable and Pointer as
separate public contract types, but do not build two unrelated parser, policy,
runtime, bridge, or binding stacks.

Scalar allocatable and pointer procedure projections are not part of this array
handle work. Scalars continue to use ordinary nullable Python values plus
`@native_call` descriptor projections such as `Allocatable(Arg(i))`,
`Pointer(Arg(i))`, `Allocatable(Return(...))`, and `Pointer(Return(...))`.
For scalar descriptor inputs, explicit `None` means a present but unallocated
allocatable descriptor or a present but unassociated pointer descriptor. Native
optional scalar descriptor dummies use the three-state scalar bridge path:
omission means `present(...)` false, explicit `None` means a present descriptor
with absent value state, and a value means a present descriptor with scalar
storage. Array handles keep a different rule: `Allocatable[T[...]] | None` and
`Pointer[T[...]] | None` mean optional absent handle only.

## Core Contract Decisions

- [x] `Allocatable[T[...]]` means a Python handle to a native allocatable array
  descriptor.
- [x] `Pointer[T[...]]` means a Python handle to a native pointer array
  descriptor.
- [x] `Allocatable[T[...]]` and `Pointer[T[...]]` are handles, not NumPy arrays.
- [x] `T[...]` remains the ordinary array data-buffer contract.
- [x] Passing a handle to an `Allocatable[T[...]]` or `Pointer[T[...]]`
  parameter uses descriptor semantics.
- [x] Passing a handle to a `T[...]` parameter uses normal array-actual
  semantics in the shared runtime handoff path. For native wrapper calls, pass
  the handle's native array actual to the normal Fortran array dummy instead of
  implicitly calling `.to_numpy()`; generated wrapper parameter integration is
  tracked separately below.
- [x] Normal `T[...]` parameters require a valid array actual: allocatable
  handles must be allocated, pointer handles must be associated, and
  allocated/associated zero-length arrays remain valid.
- [x] Unallocated allocatable handles and unassociated pointer handles are
  accepted only by descriptor-handle parameters such as `Allocatable[T[...]]`
  and `Pointer[T[...]]`, where that state belongs inside the handle.
- [x] Plain NumPy arrays are rejected by the shared runtime descriptor-parameter
  handoff for `Allocatable[T[...]]` and `Pointer[T[...]]` descriptor
  parameters; generated wrapper parameter integration is tracked separately
  below.
- [x] `| None` on a handle means the handle object itself may be absent for a
  native optional dummy, not that a present handle is unallocated or
  unassociated.
- [x] Unallocated allocatable state lives inside the allocatable handle:
  `h.allocated is False` and `h.to_numpy() is None`.
- [x] Unassociated pointer state lives inside the pointer handle:
  `p.associated is False` and `p.to_numpy() is None`.
- [x] `Annotated[T[...], Allocatable]` is not an active public allocatable-array
  spelling after migration.
- [x] `Annotated[T[...], Pointer]` is not an active public pointer-array
  spelling after migration.
- [x] `Snapshot[T]` is removed from generated and accepted active semantic
  `.pyi` contracts for this feature.
- [x] Whole-object snapshots are treated as a future feature, not part of this
  contract.
- [x] Borrowed views, detached snapshots, and descriptor handles remain distinct
  concepts in docs, diagnostics, runtime names, and tests.

## Public `.pyi` Examples

### Allocatable Handles

```python
from x2py.contracts import Allocatable, Float64, Int32

values: Allocatable[Float64[:]]

class box:
    values: Allocatable[Float64[:]]

def resize(values: Allocatable[Float64[:]], n: Int32) -> None: ...

def make_values(n: Int32) -> Allocatable[Float64[:]]: ...

def maybe_optional(
    values: Allocatable[Float64[:]] | None = ...,
) -> None: ...

def scale(values: Float64[:]) -> None: ...
```

`scale()` is ordinary array-data semantics. It may accept an allocated
`Allocatable[Float64[:]]` at runtime by passing the handle's native array actual
to the normal Fortran array dummy. It does not receive an allocatable dummy
descriptor.

### Pointer Handles

```python
from x2py.contracts import Float64, Int32, Pointer

values: Pointer[Float64[:]]

class box:
    values: Pointer[Float64[:]]

def reassociate(
    values: Pointer[Float64[:]],
    target: Pointer[Float64[:]],
) -> None: ...

def maybe_optional(
    values: Pointer[Float64[:]] | None = ...,
) -> None: ...

def scale(values: Float64[:]) -> None: ...
```

`scale()` is ordinary array-data semantics. It may accept an associated
`Pointer[Float64[:]]` at runtime by passing the handle's native array actual to
the normal Fortran array dummy. It does not receive a pointer dummy descriptor.

## Call Compatibility Model

For a normal array data signature:

```python
from x2py.contracts import Allocatable, Float64, Pointer

def f(x: Float64[:]) -> None: ...

plain: Float64[:]
allocatable: Allocatable[Float64[:]]
pointer: Pointer[Float64[:]]

f(plain)
f(allocatable)
f(pointer)
```

all three calls are valid when the runtime value can provide usable
`Float64[:]` data:

- `f(plain)` passes the NumPy/data-buffer value directly;
- `f(allocatable)` verifies that the handle is allocated and compatible, then
  passes the wrapped native allocatable array actual to the normal Fortran array
  dummy;
- `f(pointer)` verifies that the handle is associated and compatible, then
  passes the wrapped native pointer array actual to the normal Fortran array
  dummy.

This mirrors Fortran argument association: a non-allocatable array dummy can be
called with ordinary, allocatable, or pointer actual arrays when the actual
array is present/associated and otherwise valid. At the Python boundary this is
not allocatable-or-pointer dummy descriptor semantics; the callee sees a normal
array dummy. It also is not an implicit `.to_numpy()` conversion.

If the user writes `f(allocatable.to_numpy())` or `f(pointer.to_numpy())`, that
is the explicit public extraction path. The result is treated like any other
ordinary array argument and must pass the normal validation rules, including
non-`None` state and any mutability requirements.

For descriptor signatures:

```python
def g(x: Allocatable[Float64[:]]) -> None: ...

def h(x: Pointer[Float64[:]]) -> None: ...
```

`g()` requires an allocatable handle and `h()` requires a pointer handle. A
plain NumPy array is rejected because it has no native allocatable or pointer
descriptor to pass.

Internally, model this as a handle with an array-data facet plus descriptor
facts, not as a global rewrite of the base array type. For example, an
`Allocatable[Float64[:]]` value should expose or carry:

- array data type: `Float64[:]`;
- descriptor kind: `allocatable`;
- descriptor operations: allocation state, descriptor passing, deallocate, and
  resize.

A `Pointer[Float64[:]]` value should expose or carry:

- array data type: `Float64[:]`;
- descriptor kind: `pointer`;
- descriptor operations: association state, descriptor passing, nullify, and
  any policy-gated allocation/deallocation operations.
- default handle mode: `Pointer[T[...]]` must be usable without
  `PointerPolicy(...)` for conservative handle creation, association
  inspection, descriptor handoff, `nullify()` where legal, and supported
  extraction operations.
- explicit policy mode: `PointerPolicy(...)` enables or requests behavior that
  needs otherwise unprovable facts, such as allocation, deallocation,
  reassociation, target lifetime, or unsafe ownership transfer.

The implementation may use predicates or metadata equivalent to
`is_allocatable` and `is_pointer` on the specific handle semantic type, but
plain `Float64[:]` itself remains the data-buffer contract. Do not make a
normal array parameter infer descriptor semantics merely because a handle is
accepted as an array-like runtime value.

## Recommended Implementation Order

### 1. Documentation And Contract Sync

Update the public docs first so the intended behavior is explicit before code
changes.

- [x] Update `docs/user/guide/allocatables.md`.
- [x] Update `docs/user/guide/pointers.md`.
- [x] Update `docs/user/reference/semantic-pyi-format.md`.
- [x] Update memory-management or language-support pages if they describe
  allocatable or pointer arrays as NumPy arrays, `ndarray | None`, metadata
  annotations, or `Snapshot[T]`.
- [x] Document that `Allocatable[T[...]]` is a handle, not an ndarray.
- [x] Document that `Pointer[T[...]]` is a handle to pointer association state,
  not an ndarray.
- [x] Document that `h.to_numpy()` returns a borrowed view, read-only detached
  copy, or `None` depending on completed policy and current allocation state.
- [x] Document that `p.to_numpy()` returns the current target view or `None`,
  and can expose strided pointer targets when descriptor support is available.
- [x] Document that passing a handle to a handle parameter is descriptor
  passing, while passing a handle to `T[...]` uses normal array-actual
  semantics through the handle's native array-data facet.
- [x] Document call compatibility for `def f(x: T[...])`: ordinary arrays,
  allocated allocatable handles, and associated pointer handles are accepted
  as array actuals without implicit `.to_numpy()` conversion.
- [x] Document that normal `T[...]` parameters reject unallocated allocatable
  handles and unassociated pointer handles because there is no valid array
  actual to pass. Allocated or associated zero-length arrays are still valid.
- [x] Document that explicit `f(h.to_numpy())` is a separate user-requested
  ndarray path and follows ordinary ndarray validation.
- [x] Document that parameters annotated as `Allocatable[T[...]]` or
  `Pointer[T[...]]` pass native descriptors, so they require the corresponding
  handle object. Ordinary arrays are accepted only by normal `T[...]`
  parameters.
- [x] Document that plain ndarray inputs are rejected for descriptor-handle
  parameters.
- [x] Document that module allocatables and pointer arrays expose handles, not
  `ndarray | None` module attributes.
- [x] Document that derived allocatable and pointer fields expose handles.
- [x] Document that allocatable function results can return owned handles only
  when x2py creates stable owner storage.
- [x] Document that pointer handles do not imply target ownership.
- [x] Document that pointer `nullify()` is default, while pointer
  `allocate()`, `deallocate()`, and `resize()` require explicit policy.
- [x] Document stale-view hazards after descriptor-changing operations,
  reassociation, nullification, deallocation, or reallocation.
- [x] Remove active public examples of `Annotated[T[...], Allocatable]`,
  `Annotated[T[...], Pointer]`, and `Snapshot[T]` for this feature.

### 2. Public Contract Symbols, Parser, And Printer

Implement the public contract wrappers once and parameterize by descriptor kind.

- [x] Add `Allocatable[...]` as a real array-handle contract wrapper.
- [x] Add `Pointer[...]` as a real array-handle contract wrapper.
- [x] Parse `Allocatable[T[...]]` into a semantic representation for a native
  allocatable array handle.
- [x] Parse `Pointer[T[...]]` into a semantic representation for a native
  pointer array handle.
- [x] Parse optional absent callable-argument handles as
  `Allocatable[T[...]] | None = ...` and `Pointer[T[...]] | None = ...`.
- [x] Reject `Allocatable[T[...]] | None` and `Pointer[T[...]] | None` outside
  optional callable arguments.
- [x] Reject optional/defaulted callable-argument handles that omit the
  explicit `| None` spelling.
- [x] Preserve normal `T[...]` type identity as array data semantics, not
  descriptor semantics.
- [x] Reject `Snapshot[T]` in active `.pyi` contracts with a clear diagnostic.
- [x] Remove `Snapshot` from `x2py.contracts` and `CONTRACT_SYMBOLS` once
  active tests and docs are migrated.
- [x] Reject or fully migrate `Annotated[T[...], Allocatable]` from active
  public contracts.
- [x] Reject or fully migrate `Annotated[T[...], Pointer]` from active public
  contracts.
- [x] Keep metadata-only allocatable or pointer facts only as temporary internal
  migration facts, not as accepted public syntax.
- [x] Print generated module allocatables as `Allocatable[T[...]]`.
- [x] Print generated derived allocatable fields as `Allocatable[T[...]]`.
- [x] Print allocatable descriptor arguments and supported handle results as
  `Allocatable[T[...]]`.
- [x] Print generated module pointer arrays as `Pointer[T[...]]`.
- [x] Print generated derived pointer fields as `Pointer[T[...]]`.
- [x] Print pointer descriptor arguments and supported handle results as
  `Pointer[T[...]]`.

### 3. Semantic IR Representation

Create one semantic representation family for native array handles with a
descriptor-kind field rather than separate unrelated models.

- [x] Represent common native-array handle facts:
  - descriptor kind: allocatable or pointer;
  - element semantic type;
  - dtype;
  - rank;
  - shape metadata when statically known;
  - array data type/facet used when a handle is passed to a normal `T[...]`
    parameter;
  - string element length metadata when applicable;
  - optional-absent handle state;
  - source origin: module variable, derived field, argument, or result;
  - native access path.
- [x] Keep handle semantic types distinct from normal array semantic types.
- [x] Store allocatable/pointer descriptor facts on the handle semantic type,
  not as a global mutation of the plain array type.
- [x] Permit shared predicates or metadata equivalent to `is_allocatable` and
  `is_pointer` on handle semantic types when that helps policy dispatch.
- [x] Keep each handle's base array data type available for ordinary `T[...]`
  call compatibility.
- [x] Keep scalar descriptor projection metadata on the existing scalar
  nullable-value path, not on array handle types.
- [x] Preserve `T[...]` arguments/results as normal array data in semantic IR
  even when runtime may later accept a handle through data coercion.
- [x] Model `Snapshot[T]` as unsupported or future-only rather than active
  semantic IR.

### 4. Post-IR Policy Completion

Complete every semantic decision before `ir2ast.py`. Bridge and binding
generators must dispatch from these decisions rather than inferring policy from
datatype, intent, origin, dotted access shape, alias metadata, or local memory
checks.

The completed decision is recorded as `NativeArrayHandlePolicy` metadata on
each handle declaration or result type. That policy records the descriptor kind,
handle origin/kind, owner retention, borrowed-vs-owned descriptor status,
getter/setter behavior, native assignment behavior, release responsibility,
target lifetime, generated destroy behavior, storage mode, optional
absent-handle state, `.to_numpy()` extraction policy, and descriptor operation
permissions. It also records whether the selected path requires pointer C
descriptor interop or owned-allocatable CFI storage, so build integration can
gate `ISO_Fortran_binding.h` from completed policy instead of raw datatype
checks. `ir2ast.py` must fail before
lowering a native array handle that is missing this completed policy.

For pointer handles, plain `Pointer[T[...]]` gets a default conservative
operation table for descriptor association, `nullify()`, and unavailable
extraction reporting. `PointerPolicy(...)` adds facts for behavior that needs
an explicit contract. `allocate(shape)` requires an explicit reassociation
value that allows allocation, `deallocate()` requires an explicit deallocation
value, and `resize(shape)` requires both sides to opt into resize. When an
explicit pointer policy selects descriptor-view extraction, the completed policy
records the `pointer_c_descriptor` interop requirement even if another readiness
blocker still prevents wrapper lowering.

- [x] Add one completed native-array-handle policy decision shared by
  Allocatable and Pointer.
- [x] Complete descriptor kind before lowering: allocatable or pointer.
- [x] Complete handle kind before lowering:
  - `borrowed_module_descriptor`;
  - `borrowed_field_descriptor`;
  - `argument_descriptor`;
  - `owned_result_descriptor`;
  - `optional_absent_handle`;
  - `unsupported`.
- [x] Complete ownership and lifetime retention before lowering.
- [x] Complete whether the Python handle is borrowed or owned before lowering.
- [x] Complete getter behavior before lowering.
- [x] Complete Python setter exposure, if any, before lowering.
- [x] Complete native setter assignment behavior, if any, before lowering.
- [x] Complete output projection/readback behavior before lowering.
- [x] Complete release responsibility and generated destroy behavior before
  lowering.
- [x] Complete `.to_numpy()` policy before lowering:
  - `borrowed_view`;
  - `descriptor_view`;
  - `contiguous_view`;
  - `copy_only`;
  - `read_only_detached_copy`;
  - `unsupported`.
- [x] Complete pointer C-descriptor interop requirement before lowering:
  `none` or `pointer_c_descriptor`.
- [x] Complete nullability and optional-absent-handle behavior before lowering.
- [x] Complete contract-value storage mode before lowering: `stack`, `heap`, or
  `alias`.
- [x] Keep descriptor-argument and optional-absent-handle policies semantically
  complete before lowering; generated bridge descriptor pass-through dispatches
  from this completed policy.
- [x] Fail readiness with a clear diagnostic when descriptor ownership, target
  lifetime, shape, addressability, release responsibility, or extraction policy
  is incomplete.

#### Allocatable Policy Items

- [x] Complete allocated-state support.
- [x] Complete addressability/aliasability policy for `h.to_numpy()`.
- [x] Use `borrowed_view` only when safe and legal addressability is proven.
- [x] Use read-only detached copy when live aliasing is not safe.
- [x] Do not expose live NumPy views for non-addressable Fortran allocatables.
- [x] Do not call a read-only borrowed view a snapshot; snapshots are detached
  copies.
- [x] Complete `deallocate()` permission.
- [x] Complete `resize(shape)` permission.
- [x] Complete function-result ownership as wrapper-owned stable descriptor
  storage.
- [x] Mark unsupported allocatable array forms as readiness blockers rather than
  silently falling back to NumPy-array copy behavior.

#### Pointer Policy Items

- [x] Complete association-state support.
- [x] Complete target lifetime policy.
- [x] Complete `to_numpy()` extraction policy:
  - descriptor view;
  - contiguous view;
  - copy-only fallback if explicitly implemented;
  - unsupported.
- [x] Select pointer `to_numpy()` policy from completed `PointerPolicy(...)`
  facts before lowering: contiguous copy requests use `copy_only`, other
  contiguous policies use `contiguous_view`, and strided/general policies use
  `descriptor_view`.
- [x] Complete `nullify()` permission as the default pointer descriptor
  operation.
- [x] Complete a default conservative handle profile for plain
  `Pointer[T[...]]` without requiring `PointerPolicy(...)`.
- [x] Complete `allocate(shape)` permission only when explicit pointer policy
  allows allocation through this pointer.
- [x] Complete `deallocate()` permission only when explicit pointer policy
  allows deallocation through this pointer.
- [x] Add an explicit unsafe/user-responsibility deallocation policy value,
  `unsafe_deallocate`, for callers who knowingly request deallocation without
  x2py-proven target ownership.
- [x] Complete `resize(shape)` permission only when explicit pointer policy
  allows resize through this pointer.
- [x] Do not expose pointer `allocate()`, `deallocate()`, or `resize()` when
  policy disallows those operations.
- [x] Treat pointer handle ownership as descriptor/association access by
  default, not target ownership.
- [x] For pointer results, support `owned_result_descriptor` only when stable
  owner storage and target lifetime are explicit; otherwise block readiness.

### 5. Shared Runtime Handle Foundation

Add or reuse one internal runtime base for both public handle classes.

- [x] Implement or reuse `NativeArrayHandleBase`.
- [x] Put shared dtype metadata on the base.
- [x] Put shared rank metadata on the base.
- [x] Put shared shape-query dispatch on the base.
- [x] Put shared `to_numpy()` dispatch on the base.
- [x] Put shared owner/lifetime retention on the base.
- [x] Put shared generated ops table/accessor storage on the base.
- [x] Validate generated operation table names and callables when a runtime
  handle is constructed.
- [x] Require generated runtime handles to provide the shared `shape` operation
  at construction time.
- [x] Require generated runtime handles to provide an internal `array_actual`
  operation for normal `T[...]` native array-actual handoff, distinct from
  explicit public `to_numpy()` extraction.
- [x] Require generated runtime handles to provide an internal `descriptor`
  operation for `Allocatable[T[...]]` and `Pointer[T[...]]` descriptor-parameter
  handoff.
- [x] Reject generated `array_actual` or `descriptor` handoff operations that
  return `None`, so present handles cannot collapse into optional absent-handle
  state.
- [x] Require generated `array_actual` operations to return the internal typed
  native-array handoff object carrying a non-null native data address.
- [x] Require generated `descriptor` operations to return either decoded
  standard descriptor fields or a contiguous native data address that the
  shared runtime normalizes into those fields. An unallocated or unassociated
  descriptor may carry a null `base_addr`; that state remains distinct from an
  absent optional handle.
- [x] Put shared borrowed-vs-owned descriptor kind on the base.
- [x] Validate shared runtime descriptor kind at handle construction, so
  generated handles can only use `allocatable` or `pointer` descriptor tags.
- [x] Put shared owned-handle release state and finalizer dispatch on the base,
  so generated owner-storage handles can call a generated `destroy` operation
  exactly once.
- [x] Require generated owned-handle operation tables to provide a callable
  `destroy` operation at construction time.
- [x] Run owned-handle destroy operations before marking the handle closed, so
  generated destroy accessors can still read descriptor or owner state.
- [x] Mark owned handles closed after a generated destroy attempt even when
  destroy reports an error, so finalizers cannot retry the same native release.
- [x] Leave room for optional generation or stale-view tracking later.
- [x] Add an internal runtime array-actual validation and handoff hook for
  future normal `T[...]` handle inputs, without calling `to_numpy()`.
- [x] Add an internal runtime normal-array argument dispatcher that keeps
  ordinary ndarray validation and native-handle array-actual handoff as
  separate paths while sharing dtype, rank, shape, layout, and writeability
  checks.
- [x] Add an internal runtime normal-array argument ABI packer that returns the
  generated Bind-C array tuple fields from either an ndarray data pointer or a
  native handle `array_actual` handoff: pointer address, optional runtime rank,
  optional item size, extents, and optional upper bounds plus unit strides.
- [x] Normalize runtime layout validation for handle array-actual handoff with
  the same supported `C` and `F` layout expectations used by the ndarray path.
- [x] Normalize runtime handle shapes as non-negative extents, rejecting
  negative dimensions while preserving zero-length arrays as valid array
  actuals.
- [x] Let the internal runtime normal-array argument dispatcher enforce native
  byte order and alignment when generated binding policy requests those checks.
- [x] Add an internal runtime descriptor-parameter validation and handoff hook
  for future `Allocatable[T[...]]` and `Pointer[T[...]]` binding inputs,
  including optional absent-handle `None` mapping.
- [x] Validate descriptor-parameter handoff kind before mapping optional
  absent-handle `None`, so unsupported descriptor kinds cannot silently pass.
- [x] Add an internal runtime descriptor-argument field packer that returns
  validated `base_addr`, `elem_len`, `rank`, and per-dimension lower-bound,
  extent, and stride-multiplier facts. Generated C uses those facts to establish
  call-local `CFI_CDESC_T(rank)` storage for non-projected descriptor calls;
  Python never supplies compiler-private descriptor storage.
- [x] Add a distinct direct standard-C-descriptor handoff for projected writable
  handles. Owned allocatable handles pass their persistent `CFI_cdesc_t*` so
  native allocation, deallocation, and shape changes update the same caller
  handle instead of a discarded call-local descriptor copy.
- [x] Use a dedicated non-null runtime presence token for present optional
  handle arguments, rather than reusing the descriptor handoff object as the
  presence field.
- [x] Pack optional descriptor arguments with the same validated descriptor
  facts plus a distinct presence token. Optional absent handles produce null
  fact fields and a null presence token; present unallocated or unassociated
  handles produce present descriptor facts whose `base_addr` may be null.
- [x] Carry the completed `.to_numpy()` extraction policy on the runtime
  handle.
- [x] Apply read-only detached-copy policy in the runtime handle, after the
  generated operation supplies current storage.
- [x] Validate generated `.to_numpy()` operations return either a NumPy array or
  `None` before applying borrowed-view, descriptor-view, or detached-copy
  policy.
- [x] Validate non-`None` `.to_numpy()` results against the handle's declared
  dtype and rank before returning them to Python.
- [x] Short-circuit absent descriptor state before generated extraction, so an
  unallocated allocatable handle or unassociated pointer handle returns `None`
  from `to_numpy()` without relying on backend extraction code.
- [x] Reject generated `.to_numpy()` results that report `None` after the
  handle has reported present descriptor state, so backend extraction cannot
  collapse allocated or associated handles into absent state.
- [x] Require generated runtime handles with an extraction-enabled
  `to_numpy_policy` to provide the generated `to_numpy` operation at
  construction time; handles without extraction support must use
  `to_numpy_policy="unsupported"`.
- [x] Enforce contiguous-view and copy-only `.to_numpy()` policies in the
  shared runtime handle.
- [x] Implement `AllocatableArray` as a descriptor-specific subclass.
- [x] Require allocatable runtime handles to provide the generated `allocated`
  operation at construction time.
- [x] Implement `PointerArray` as a descriptor-specific subclass.
- [x] Require pointer runtime handles to provide generated `associated` and
  default `nullify` operations at construction time.

Runtime handle support means the shared Python class enforces the completed
policy once generated operations provide access to current native storage.
Bridge generation for module variables, fields, arguments, results, and C
descriptor extraction remains tracked in the codegen and integration sections
below.

#### Allocatable Runtime API

- [x] `h.allocated -> bool`
- [x] `h.shape -> tuple[int, ...] | None`
- [x] `h.to_numpy() -> ndarray | None`
- [x] `h.deallocate()`
- [x] `h.resize(shape)`
- [x] `h.to_numpy()` returns `None` when unallocated.
- [x] `h.to_numpy()` returns a live mutable borrowed view when
  addressability/aliasability policy proves it safe.
- [x] `h.to_numpy()` returns a read-only detached NumPy snapshot when live
  aliasing is not safe.
- [x] Users can call `.copy()` on the returned NumPy array when they need
  independent lifetime.

#### Pointer Runtime API

- [x] `p.associated -> bool`
- [x] `p.shape -> tuple[int, ...] | None`
- [x] `p.to_numpy() -> ndarray | None`
- [x] `p.nullify()`
- [x] Optional, policy-gated `p.allocate(shape)`
- [x] Optional, policy-gated `p.deallocate()`
- [x] Optional, policy-gated `p.resize(shape)`
- [x] `p.to_numpy()` returns `None` when unassociated.
- [x] `p.to_numpy()` returns a live borrowed NumPy view when associated and
  descriptor extraction is supported.
- [x] `p.to_numpy()` supports strided views when descriptor support is
  available.
- [x] `p.to_numpy()` raises a clear error when descriptor extraction is
  unavailable and no fallback is supported.
- [x] Old borrowed views are documented as stale after native code nullifies,
  reassociates, deallocates, or otherwise changes the pointer target.

### 6. IR-to-AST And Codegen Model

Lower only completed policy decisions into named implementation methods.

- [x] Use one completed array interop policy object for array-like bridge and
  binding decisions. The policy selects a named ABI lane:
  `data_buffer` for ordinary `T[...]` NumPy/data-pointer semantics, or
  `descriptor` for `Allocatable[T[...]]` and `Pointer[T[...]]` descriptor
  semantics.
- [x] Keep the generated implementation methods separate under that dispatcher:
  the data-buffer lane emits the existing pointer/shape/stride ABI for normal
  arrays, while the descriptor lane emits descriptor-handle ABI operations and
  any gated TS 29113 reader code.
- [x] Add codegen model nodes or metadata for native-array handle creation.
- [x] Add codegen model nodes or metadata for generated native-array handle ops.
- [x] Route Allocatable and Pointer handles through the same lowering path with
  descriptor-kind-specific operations.
- [x] Keep `@native_call Addr(Arg(i))` as data-address projection only.
- [x] Add native-array-handle bridge/binding dispatchers keyed by completed
  descriptor kind and handle kind.
- [x] Route native-array module-variable bridge generation through completed
  handle policy before ordinary module-variable array dispatch.
- [x] Route native-array derived-field bridge and binding generation through
  completed handle policy before ordinary field array dispatch.
- [x] Route native-array function-result bridge and binding generation through
  completed handle policy before ordinary array result dispatch.
- [x] Select descriptor passing from `Allocatable[T[...]]` or
  `Pointer[T[...]]` plus completed policy, not from `Addr`.
- [x] Lower unsupported policy decisions to readiness/codegen blockers, not
  fallback behavior.

### 7. Bridge Generation

Generate descriptor-access routines through the shared handle-ops shape, then
specialize operation bodies by descriptor kind.

- [x] Block generated descriptor-handle accessors with explicit native-array
  codegen blockers until the descriptor-access routines below exist.
- [x] Add the shared Bind-C/binding/runtime construction substrate for
  generated handle objects: explicit operation-name maps, module-owner
  retention, runtime factory creation, and pointer-address handoff wrapping.
- [x] Generate module allocatable handles as borrowed descriptor handles.
- [x] Create module allocatable handle objects at module initialization.
- [x] Store complete generated operation pointers/accessors for module
  allocatable variables, including portable descriptor handoff and generated
  `resize(shape)` operations. The operation table covers state, shape,
  array-actual and descriptor-fact handoff, `.to_numpy()`, `deallocate()`, and
  `resize(shape)` without exposing a compiler-private descriptor layout.
- [x] Do not move ownership out of the Fortran module for ordinary module
  allocatable attribute reads.
- [x] Generate derived-field allocatable handles as borrowed descriptor handles.
- [x] Keep the parent wrapper object alive for derived-field allocatable
  handles.
- [x] Generate field operations that access `parent%field`.
- [x] Generate owned allocatable function-result handles when policy supports
  stable owner storage.
- [x] Use wrapper-owned standard C descriptor storage for allocatable results:
  allocate persistent rank-specific `CFI_CDESC_T(rank)` storage, establish it
  with allocatable attribute, and allocate its payload with `CFI_allocate`.
- [x] Copy the bridge-local native allocatable result or hidden output into the
  persistent CFI allocation before releasing the bridge-local storage. Do not
  return or copy a compiler-private Fortran descriptor record.
- [x] Return a native pointer to owner storage for owned allocatable handles.
- [x] Generate destroy routines called by the Python handle finalizer for owned
  allocatable handles.
- [x] Generate module pointer handles as borrowed descriptor handles.
- [x] Create module pointer handle objects at module initialization.
- [x] Store complete generated operation pointers/accessors for module pointer
  variables, including portable descriptor handoff and policy-gated
  `allocate(shape)`, `deallocate()`, and `resize(shape)` operations. The current
  generated module operation table covers association state, shape,
  pointer-address handoff wrappers, `nullify()`, and the policy-gated
  shape-changing operations when completed policy enables them. Descriptor
  handoff uses standard C descriptor facts rather than guessing a compiler
  descriptor layout.
- [x] Do not transfer ownership of pointer targets for module pointer handles.
- [x] Generate derived-field pointer handles as borrowed descriptor handles.
- [x] Keep the parent wrapper object alive for derived-field pointer handles.
- [x] Generate field operations that access `parent%field`.
- [x] Route pointer descriptor-argument bridge and binding generation through
  completed handle policy before ordinary array argument dispatch.
- [x] Model native descriptor-handle argument handoff as a dedicated Bind-C
  descriptor tuple selected by bridge and binding descriptor-argument handlers
  through completed output-projection policy. Non-projected calls establish
  standard call-local descriptor storage from validated runtime facts.
  Projected writable calls pass persistent standard C descriptor storage
  directly so descriptor mutation remains attached to the caller handle. Both
  paths add an explicit presence token only for optional absent handles.
- [x] Generate pointer descriptor-argument handoff for `Pointer[T[...]]`
  parameters.
- [x] Route allocatable descriptor-argument bridge and binding generation
  through completed handle policy before ordinary array argument dispatch.
- [x] Generate allocatable descriptor-argument handoff for
  `Allocatable[T[...]]` parameters.
- [x] Do not guess compiler-specific descriptor layouts. Descriptor-based
  interop must use the TS 29113 / Fortran 2018 C descriptor path or fail
  readiness with an explicit diagnostic.

#### Pointer Descriptor Extraction

This path is feature-gated. It may use TS 29113 / Fortran 2018 C descriptors
only when descriptor-view interop is selected, and it must not add a global
`ISO_Fortran_binding.h` requirement to wrappers that do not need descriptor
decoding.

- [x] Use TS 29113 / Fortran 2018 C descriptors for general pointer-array
  `to_numpy()` when this path is enabled.
- [x] Use `ISO_Fortran_binding.h` only for descriptor-based pointer interop
  paths.
- [x] Do not require `ISO_Fortran_binding.h` globally.
- [x] In the shared runtime helper, build NumPy shape from decoded descriptor
  `dim[i].extent` fields supplied by generated descriptor-interoperability
  code.
- [x] In the shared runtime helper, build NumPy strides from decoded descriptor
  `dim[i].sm` fields supplied by generated descriptor-interoperability code.
- [x] Let pointer `descriptor_view` extraction operations return decoded
  descriptor fields as mappings or field-record objects, with the shared
  runtime converting those fields into the NumPy view instead of requiring
  every generated operation to call the helper.
- [x] Validate decoded pointer descriptor rank against the handle's declared
  rank before constructing the NumPy view.
- [x] Reject decoded pointer descriptors with null `base_addr` after the handle
  has reported associated state.
- [x] Support positive and negative descriptor stride multipliers in the shared
  runtime descriptor-view helper by computing the full buffer window before
  constructing the NumPy view.
- [x] In the shared runtime helper, read and validate decoded descriptor
  `base_addr`, `elem_len`, `rank`, `dim[i].lower_bound`, `dim[i].extent`, and
  `dim[i].sm` fields for pointer views.
- [x] Add a shared generated C/CPython descriptor-reader primitive that decodes
  a `CFI_cdesc_t*` into the runtime descriptor-view mapping shape, without
  exposing TS 29113 layout details in public Python APIs.
- [x] Generate code that reads TS 29113 descriptor `base_addr`, `elem_len`,
  `rank`, `dim[i].lower_bound`, `dim[i].extent`, and `dim[i].sm` for pointer
  descriptor-view operations in private generated CPython operation wrappers.
- [x] Support strided pointer targets, including negative strides, in the shared
  runtime once generated descriptor-interoperability code supplies decoded
  descriptor fields.
- [x] If descriptor support is unavailable, choose one explicit policy:
  contiguous-only pointer views when shape/address are safely available,
  explicitly implemented copy fallback, or readiness failure with a clear
  diagnostic. The current selected fallback is `readiness_failure` in the
  readiness blocker payload.

### 8. Python Binding Generation

Keep descriptor-handle argument conversion separate from normal array data
conversion. For normal `T[...]` parameters, support both ordinary ndarray inputs
and native handle inputs, but do not implement handle inputs by implicitly
calling `.to_numpy()`. The handle path should route to a native array-actual
handoff when the wrapped call is native.

- [x] Accept `AllocatableArray` objects for `Allocatable[T[...]]` parameters.
- [x] Reject plain NumPy arrays for `Allocatable[T[...]]` parameters.
- [x] Accept `PointerArray` objects for `Pointer[T[...]]` parameters.
- [x] Reject plain NumPy arrays for `Pointer[T[...]]` parameters.
- [x] Accept `None` for optional-absent handle parameters only when the `.pyi`
  annotation includes `| None`.
- [x] Convert `None` optional handles into native absent optional dummies, not
  into unallocated or unassociated handle objects.
  The CPython binding layer now packs required and optional descriptor-handle
  arguments through the runtime descriptor-argument helper, and bridge
  generation passes descriptor dummies through the Bind-C descriptor tuple.
- [x] For normal `T[...]` parameters, accept ndarray inputs through the existing
  array data path.
- [x] For concrete-rank numeric normal `T[...]` parameters in generated Bind-C
  wrapper calls, accept allocated allocatable handles only by validating the
  handle state and passing the wrapped native allocatable array actual to the
  normal native array dummy.
- [x] For concrete-rank numeric normal `T[...]` parameters in generated Bind-C
  wrapper calls, accept associated pointer handles only by validating the
  handle state and passing the wrapped native pointer array actual to the normal
  native array dummy.
- [x] Share dtype, rank, shape, layout, and mutability validation policy between
  ndarray inputs and handle inputs for concrete-rank numeric `T[...]`, while
  keeping the existing ndarray pointer/shape handoff and native-handle
  array-actual handoff as separate generated implementation branches.
- [x] Treat explicit `h.to_numpy()` or `p.to_numpy()` results that are NumPy
  arrays as ordinary ndarray input through the existing array-storage path.
- [x] Reject read-only arrays returned by explicit `h.to_numpy()` or
  `p.to_numpy()` when the native dummy requires writable storage, reusing the
  existing writable ndarray validation.
- [x] Add direct wrapper coverage showing explicit `h.to_numpy()` or
  `p.to_numpy()` returning `None` is rejected as an ordinary ndarray argument
  for non-nullable `T[...]` dummies.
- [x] Reject unallocated allocatable handles for concrete-rank numeric `T[...]`
  unless nullable data-buffer behavior is explicitly implemented.
- [x] Reject unassociated pointer handles for concrete-rank numeric `T[...]`
  unless nullable data-buffer behavior is explicitly implemented.
- [x] Reject unallocated allocatable handles for optional, assumed-rank, and
  character `T[...]` unless nullable
  data-buffer behavior is explicitly implemented.
- [x] Reject unassociated pointer handles for optional, assumed-rank, and
  character `T[...]` unless nullable
  data-buffer behavior is explicitly implemented.

### 9. Compilation And Build Gating

- [x] Require descriptor interop support only when a generated wrapper uses the
  pointer C-descriptor path or persistent CFI owner storage for an allocatable
  result.
- [x] Do not require `ISO_Fortran_binding.h` for allocatable-only builds that
  contain no owned allocatable result handles.
- [x] Require `ISO_Fortran_binding.h` locally when owned allocatable result
  handles use persistent `CFI_CDESC_T` storage.
- [x] Do not require `ISO_Fortran_binding.h` for pointer builds that do not use
  descriptor-based pointer interop.
- [x] Collect native-array build requirements from completed handle policy
  metadata, not from raw `Allocatable[...]` or `Pointer[...]` syntax.
- [x] Record native-array build requirements in replayable `.pyi` wrapper build
  manifests.
- [x] Emit a clear readiness or build diagnostic when pointer descriptor interop
  is required but unavailable.

  operations, not association inspection, handle passing, or other safe default
  handle operations.

  the explicit policy value and never by default.

  `contiguous_view`, or `descriptor_view` before lowering, and only
  descriptor-view paths request pointer C-descriptor interop.

  readiness blocker while that interop path is unavailable.

### Shared Runtime Handle Tests

  absent descriptor fact fields.

  native-array handoff object with a non-null pointer address, rejecting
  booleans, non-integers, zero addresses, negative addresses, and arbitrary
  Python objects before generated bridge handoff.

- [x] Verify generated `.to_numpy()` arrays and decoded pointer descriptor
  views must match the handle's declared dtype and rank.
- [x] Verify `to_numpy()` returns `None` for unallocated allocatable handles and

  expectations consistently with ndarray validation and rejects unsupported

  generated Bind-C array tuple shape for ndarray inputs and for
  allocated/associated handle inputs without calling `to_numpy()`.
- [x] Verify the internal runtime normal-array argument dispatcher preserves
  zero-length array actuals and rejects handle shapes with negative extents.

  byte-swapped or unaligned ndarray inputs when generated binding policy
  requests native byte order or alignment.
- [x] Verify the internal runtime descriptor-parameter hook accepts only the
  matching handle class/kind, rejects ordinary arrays, validates expected dtype,
  rank, and shape, and maps optional `None` to an absent native handle.
- [x] Verify optional absent-handle `None` still rejects unsupported descriptor
  kinds before returning the native absent-handle sentinel.
- [x] Verify the internal runtime descriptor-argument field packer returns
  `base_addr`, `elem_len`, `rank`, and each dimension's lower bound, extent, and
  stride multiplier; maps optional absent-handle `None` to null fact fields;
  and uses a distinct non-null presence token for present optional handles.
- [x] Verify projected writable handle arguments require a typed direct
  standard-descriptor handoff and reject fact-only descriptors before native
  mutation can detach the caller's handle state.
- [x] Verify CPython binding generation packs required and optional
  descriptor-handle arguments through the runtime helper, dispatches
  non-projected calls to standard call-local CFI storage, dispatches projected
  writable calls to persistent descriptor storage, and passes the selected
