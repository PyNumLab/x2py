# Wrapper Plan Migration Checklist

This file is the canonical implementation contract for wrapper-plan migration.
It replaces the generic semantic-IR wrapper lowering route one eligible module
at a time. The migration changes representation and generation organization; it
does not intentionally change the established Python, native ABI, ownership, or
build behavior of a migrated lane.

## Canonical Pipeline

```text
Semantic IR
  -> post-IR policy completion
  -> WrapperPlanner.build(module)
  -> editable ModulePlan
  -> WrapperCodeGenerator.generate(plan)
       -> freeze and validate the received plan
       -> recursively synthesize C binding nodes
       -> recursively synthesize Fortran bridge nodes
       -> print backend nodes
       -> RenderedGeneratedWrapperArtifacts
  -> existing build/link orchestration
```

There is no public or wrapper-domain representation between `ModulePlan` and
backend syntax nodes. `CModule`, `CHeader`, `CFunction`, `FortranModule`, and
`FortranFunction` are direct printer inputs, not another wrapper planning
stage.

The public generation boundary is deliberately small:

```python
complete_semantic_policies(module)
plan = WrapperPlanner().build(module)
artifacts = WrapperCodeGenerator().generate(plan)
```

`WrapperCodeGenerator.generate` accepts `ModulePlan` only. It does not accept
semantic modules, build a plan itself, select an alternate lowering route, or
retry a prior route after direct generation begins.

Semantic `.pyi` generation remains outside this route. A semantic `.pyi`
contract can supply the semantic module consumed by planning, but planning does
not change `.pyi` emission.

## One Shared Plan, Explicit Backend Views

`ModulePlan` is one shared semantic-and-ABI contract. It is not a C plan joined
to a Fortran plan and it does not contain backend nodes or source text.

Every owner that crosses or coordinates the boundary has binding and bridge
child plans in the same editable tree:

```text
ModulePlan
  binding: BindingModulePlan
  bridge: BridgeModulePlan
  functions: FunctionPlan ...
    binding: BindingFunctionPlan
    bridge: BridgeFunctionPlan
    arguments: ArgumentTransferPlan ...
      binding: BindingArgumentPlan
      bridge: BridgeArgumentPlan
      native_call_slot: NativeCallSlotPlan
      transformations: TransformationPlan ...
    results: ResultPlan ...
      binding: BindingResultPlan
      bridge: BridgeResultPlan
      native_call_slot: NativeCallSlotPlan | None
      transformations: TransformationPlan ...
    lifecycle: LifecycleActionPlan ...
      binding: BindingLifecyclePlan | None
      bridge: BridgeLifecyclePlan | None
    native_call_slots: ordered references to argument/result slots plus
      function-owned literal or helper slots
```

`ArgumentTransferPlan` remains the only argument-owner record; do not add a
generic duplicate `ArgumentPlan`. Its backend-facing child plans are
deliberately distinct and directly editable:

- `binding: BindingArgumentPlan` describes the Python input, its C conversion
  action, and
  the C handoff value/role it produces;
- `bridge: BridgeArgumentPlan` describes the C ABI slot, value-versus-address
  convention,
  native action, and Fortran value that the bridge consumes;
- `native_call_slot` records the exact native-call position and source;
- an argument or hidden result's `native_call_slot` is the same mutable record
  referenced from `FunctionPlan.native_call_slots`, not a copied record that a
  maintainer must edit twice;
- result and lifecycle records identify later producers, consumers, ordering,
  and responsibility through their own binding and bridge views;
- native slots and lifecycle actions are subordinate transfer details, not
  parallel datatype-policy systems. They remain indexed on `FunctionPlan`
  because native ABI order and success/failure lifecycle order may span more
  than one argument or result. A function-owned literal, status helper, or
  other ABI slot may also have no single argument/result owner.

The action vocabulary keeps source placement, data transfer, and native ABI
transport orthogonal. `ResultPlan.source_kind` says whether a result comes from
a `direct_return` or `hidden_output`; `CodegenAction` says how the value moves
or is owned (`DIRECT_VALUE`, `COPY_OUT`, `WRAPPER_INSTANCE`, and so on). A
hidden scalar therefore remains `DIRECT_VALUE`, while hidden strings and
ordinary arrays are `COPY_OUT`; hidden descriptor-owned objects use their
completed ownership action. `HIDDEN_OUTPUT` is not a codegen action because
hiddenness is a source location, not a transfer operation.

Likewise, `NativeBarrierAction.PASS_ARRAY_BUFFER` means the Phase 6 data-buffer
ABI whose handoff plan carries data, rank, extents, strides, and itemsize.
`NativeBarrierAction.PASS_NATIVE_DESCRIPTOR` is reserved for the persistent
native descriptors and handles introduced in Phase 7. Neither backend may use
one action as a fallback for the other.

`NativeBarrierAction.PASS_RAW_ADDRESS` is the third, deliberately narrower
array transport: one caller-supplied opaque address plus separately completed
pointee rank, shape, element type, and orientation facts. It does not authorize
NumPy extraction, a packed array-buffer ABI, or a native descriptor. Scalar,
fixed-string, and array raw addresses reuse this action and
`ArgumentHandoffMode.OPAQUE_ADDRESS`; their object kind then selects the named
bridge association method. Do not add datatype-specific raw-address actions.

The binding input and bridge input may have different representations: a C
binding commonly receives `PyObject *`, produces a C scalar or address, and
the bridge then consumes a value or pointer according to its ABI slot. The plan
therefore records the producer/consumer handoff contract explicitly; it does
not assume identical types or actions. This keeps both backend plans in one
coherent editable tree while preventing them from drifting into disconnected
top-level plans. `CBindingGenerator` reads only binding views plus shared
handoff/order facts needed to create C nodes; `FortranBridgeGenerator` reads
only bridge views plus shared native-call order needed to create Fortran nodes.
Neither backend output is an input to the other backend.

An owner may have only one active backend side when completed policy places the
behavior entirely in one backend, but that ownership must be explicit in the
plan rather than inferred during lowering.

### Transformation Layer Ownership

Every representation transformation has one explicit
`TransformationPlan.layer`: `BINDING` or `BRIDGE`. The record also names its
phase (`COPY_IN`, `NATIVE_MUTATION`, `COPY_OUT`, or `CLEANUP`), typed action,
source representation, target representation, and reason. These records are
subordinate to the `ArgumentTransferPlan` or `ResultPlan` that owns the value;
they are not a parallel datatype-policy hierarchy.

Use the binding layer for transformations involving Python objects or NumPy
semantics: dtype/layout conversion, Python encoding/decoding, reference and
identity handling, copy-back into caller objects, and Python-owned temporary
cleanup. Use the bridge layer for transformations wholly between the ABI and a
native-language representation: Fortran character representation, native
descriptor/result materialization, derived native layout, or native-only
allocation and copy.

One logical conversion and its inverse/cleanup must stay at one layer. If a
workflow genuinely needs both layers, policy completion records two distinct
transformations separated by a named intermediate ABI representation. A
backend consumes only transformations assigned to it and fails validation if
asked to lower an action owned by the other backend. Method location, datatype,
`intent`, and available local storage never select the transformation layer.
For `COPY_F`, copy-in, conditional copy-out, and cleanup are all binding-owned;
the bridge has no `COPY_F` transformation and reuses its ordinary ORDER_F
association path.

### Editable Signature And Native Intent Boundary

The semantic `.pyi` signature is authoritative for the Python-facing call
shape. The source converter may use native `intent` to propose the initial
generated signature, but that proposal is not backend policy. A user may
reorder visible Python arguments, keep a native output dummy as caller-supplied
storage, project it into a Python result, or introduce hidden bridge storage.
After the semantic contract is constructed or edited, completed native-call
slots must account for every required native position exactly once; stored
source `intent` must not silently override that mapping by hiding, exposing,
reordering, allocating, or projecting a Python value.

Bridge dummies and backend-local variables use the most permissive declaration
that is compatible with the selected ABI, normally no `intent` or an internal
`intent(inout)`-equivalent writable local. The called native procedure enforces
its actual `intent(in)`, `intent(out)`, or `intent(inout)` contract. Required
interoperability attributes such as `value`, optional presence fields, standard
descriptor attributes, and true bridge-output parameters remain explicit ABI
facts; they are not permission for a backend to reconstruct the user-facing
signature from native `intent`.

The plan includes every fact required for mechanical lowering:

- owner path and plan-node kind;
- typed Python, native, and result actions;
- semantic datatype, datatype family, and precision/type facts;
- Python/native handoffs and bridge ABI slots;
- native-call slots in their exact order;
- result and output projection;
- ownership, transfer, destruction, mutability, writeback, release
  responsibility, storage mode, nullability, and lifecycle ordering; and
- every typed lowering choice required by a supported backend.

It contains decisions and facts, never generator method names. In particular,
there are no handler-name fields, handler records, or plan-owned handler
registries. The planner uses the completed policy actions already represented
by `PythonBarrierAction`, `NativeBarrierAction`, and `CodegenAction`; a new
typed action is added only when none of those can identify a necessary
mechanical behavior. Free-form string actions are forbidden.

## Ownership Boundary

Post-IR policy completion decides object kind, ownership, transfer,
destruction, mutability, writeback, nullability, output projection, release
responsibility, contract-value storage (`stack`, `heap`, or `alias`), getter
behavior, native setter assignment, Python setter exposure, ABI order, and
lifecycle order before planning starts.

`WrapperPlanner` only projects those completed decisions and datatype facts
into readable editable records. It may traverse owners, preserve declared
order, assign stable owner paths, and wire already-decided producers to
consumers. It must not derive or replace policy from a datatype, `intent`,
decorator spelling, `is_alias`, dotted owner shape, local memory observation,
or a missing field.

No code after planning may infer, replace, or override semantic policy. Backend
contexts may allocate temporary names and create declarations, error paths,
reference-count operations, and local cleanup statements after selecting a
typed lowering case. Those are emitted-code mechanics, not plan policy.

`WrapperPlanner.build(module)` returns an editable `ModulePlan`. Maintainers
may edit its ordinary fields to inspect an experiment before generation. A
permanent behavior change belongs in the semantic contract and completed policy
rather than in a backend exception.

## Generator-Owned Freezing and Validation

Every consumer freezes the exact object it receives:

```text
editable ModulePlan -- WrapperCodeGenerator --> frozen ModulePlan
editable backend modules -- source printers --> frozen backend modules
editable generated artifacts -- build integration --> frozen artifacts
```

At the start of `WrapperCodeGenerator.generate(plan)`, the generator must:

1. recursively freeze that exact plan object;
2. run the complete binding/bridge plan-consistency validation on the final
   edited plan;
3. ask each backend to preflight only its own implementation capability; and
4. recursively lower the validated plan into backend nodes before the printers
   consume those nodes.

Later mutation of the received plan raises `FrozenStageRecordError`. Backend
nodes remain editable until their printer consumes them. Generated artifacts
remain editable until `_build_rendered_wrapper_extension(...)` consumes them.

`WrapperPlanner` does not validate its output. It mechanically projects an
editable plan, which may temporarily be inconsistent while a maintainer edits
it. `WrapperCodeGenerator` owns the private structured validation methods and
is the only validation consumer. There is no standalone validator class or
public validation operation.

`WrapperCodeGenerator._validate_plan()` is the single plan-consistency gate.
It validates the complete binding/bridge graph after the editable plan has
been frozen and before either backend preflight or visitor runs. The gate stays
small by composing `_plan_diagnostics()` from typed private diagnostics for
namespaces, functions, arguments, results, lifecycle actions, and module
variable getter/setter action families. A cross-view invariant belongs to the
diagnostic for the lowest plan node that contains both views; for example, a
module-variable diagnostic validates Python setter exposure against its native
assignment and bridge setter role.

`CBindingGenerator.require_supported()` and
`FortranBridgeGenerator.require_supported()` are later backend-local
capability preflights. They may reject a completed action, primitive type,
descriptor kind, or ABI combination that their own backend cannot implement,
but they do not establish whether binding and bridge views agree. Backend
visitors and `_lower_*` methods mechanically consume the decisions owned by
their view. Their exhaustive unmatched-action errors remain defensive
protection for direct backend use; the public generation path must report a
cross-view inconsistency from `_validate_plan()` first. No generator infers
consistency by reading the other backend's plan view.

Structural validation preserves these invariants:

- module getter actions and roles agree, and Python setter exposure agrees with
  native assignment, bridge setter roles, descriptor kinds, and constant state;
- binding producer and bridge consumer roles agree;
- bridge ABI coverage, positions, and owner roles are complete;
- native-call slot coverage, exact ordering, hidden literals, and hidden
  results agree, including hidden-result native and codegen actions;
- direct and hidden result producer/consumer roles agree;
- writeback, cleanup, and release actions use available source roles in their
  declared order, and advertised roles exactly match their plan producers;
- positions and symbolic roles are neither duplicate nor missing; and
- external and bind-target requirements are complete.

## Direct Recursive Lowering

`WrapperCodeGenerator` owns two private backend visitors:

```python
c_module, c_header = CBindingGenerator().visit(plan)
fortran_module = FortranBridgeGenerator().visit(plan)
```

They are private implementation organization inside direct generation, not
public stages. Both visitors recursively traverse the same plan tree and
return actual C or Fortran nodes (or tuples of actual nodes where a child needs
multiple declarations or statements).

The recursive shape is:

```text
ModulePlan
  -> binding and bridge module contexts and backend nodes
  -> NamespacePlan
       -> directly owned FunctionPlan and ModuleVariablePlan records
       -> binding/bridge argument transfers, result projection, lifecycle actions
       -> complete backend function and namespace nodes
  -> complete backend module node
```

An argument visitor returns the C or Fortran declarations/statements/parameters
needed for that backend. A result visitor returns the backend result nodes.
Lifecycle visitors return backend writeback, cleanup, or release nodes. Parent
visitors assemble these concrete child results directly into complete syntax
nodes. Do not introduce another wrapper-specific transport model.

The public orchestration stays visibly direct:

```python
class WrapperCodeGenerator:
    def generate(self, plan: ModulePlan) -> RenderedGeneratedWrapperArtifacts:
        plan.freeze()
        self._validate_plan(plan)
        self._c_generator.require_supported(plan)
        self._fortran_generator.require_supported(plan)

        c_module, c_header = self._c_generator.visit(plan)
        fortran_module = self._fortran_generator.visit(plan)

        c_source = self._c_printer.doprint(c_module)
        c_header_source = self._c_printer.doprint(c_header)
        fortran_source = self._fortran_printer.doprint(fortran_module)
        return self._rendered_artifacts(
            plan.owner_path,
            c_source,
            c_header_source,
            fortran_source,
        )
```

The generator constructs `RenderedGeneratedWrapperArtifacts` directly from the
printed source plus artifact metadata. It does not duplicate native build plans,
compiler selection, link ordering, native-support installation, or compilation
policy; those remain in existing build/link orchestration.

## Direct Lowering Methods

Each backend visitor dispatches plan nodes by class through
`_visit_<PlanClass>`. A visitor method then calls a typed
`_lower_<subject>` helper for each completed action family owned by that
backend. The helper uses an explicit, exhaustive action match and calls one
concrete `_lower_<subject>_<action>` implementation method. For example:

```python
def _visit_ModuleVariablePlan(self, plan):
    return (
        *self._lower_module_getter(plan),
        *self._lower_module_setter(plan),
    )

def _lower_module_getter(self, plan):
    match plan.binding.getter_action:
        case ModuleGetterAction.CONSTANT_VALUE:
            return self._lower_module_getter_constant_value(plan)
        case ModuleGetterAction.DIRECT_VALUE:
            return self._lower_module_getter_direct_value(plan)
        case ModuleGetterAction.NULLABLE_SNAPSHOT:
            return self._lower_module_getter_nullable_snapshot(plan)
    raise ValueError(...)
```

The C binding dispatches only from binding-owned actions, and the Fortran
bridge dispatches only from bridge-owned actions. In particular, native module
setter generation consumes the completed bridge assignment action rather than
the Python setter-exposure action. Post-IR policy completion records
`AssignmentMode.NONE` when no native setter is exposed and
`AssignmentMode.VALUE_COPY` for supported scalar value write-through; bridge
lowering does not reconstruct that choice from the Python setter action.
Backend support checks retain genuine ABI and capability validation; action
dispatch itself raises explicitly for every unsupported value, including an
unsupported alias assignment.

Do not synthesize implementation method names, use `getattr` to execute
lowering, retain a fallback behavior, or store dispatcher names in the plan.
Do not create extra getter or setter plan nodes solely to gain more
`_visit_<PlanClass>` methods. Both visitor and lowering methods return backend
syntax nodes; printers remain the only layer that renders those nodes as source
text.

Primitive dtype spelling and converter differences live in the intentionally
scalar-specific `PrimitiveScalarTypeRegistry`; they do not duplicate control
flow methods or select semantic policy.

Within policy, planning, support analysis, validation, and both backend
visitors, family-specific helpers stay in visibly labeled contiguous groups:
scalar helpers, string helpers, and ordinary-array helpers. Put a short section
comment above every such group so maintainers can find one datatype family
without scanning interleaved lowering methods. Generic orchestration remains
outside those groups and dispatches into them through the completed typed
actions.

## Migration and Route Rules

The legacy route remains the behavioral oracle until a lane has direct-plan
parity. Route selection is atomic per merged extension: a generation unit uses
either the direct wrapper-plan route or the legacy route. It never combines one
backend from one route with the other backend from the other route.

The documented public contract is authoritative when it intentionally corrects
legacy behavior. In that case, use the legacy implementation to simplify the
mechanical ABI, conversion, ownership, and cleanup audit, improve the design
where the legacy path is unsafe or unnecessarily complex, and record every
intentional behavioral difference in focused tests. Do not preserve a known
legacy defect merely to obtain byte-for-byte or semantic parity.

An unsupported owner may select the legacy route before planning. Once the plan
route is selected, planning, validation, lowering, printing, or compilation
failure fails the build; it must not fall back to legacy generation.

Support reports and rollout gates keep scalar, string, and ordinary-array
input, optional, writeback, direct-result, and hidden-result lanes distinct.
Evidence for one datatype family must not make another family production
eligible accidentally.

For each lane:

1. replay an existing passing `tests/wrapper` case through the legacy route and
   retain its generated artifacts;
2. record the relevant legacy source paths, ABI/call order, ownership and
   cleanup behavior, artifact requirements, and runtime assertions;
3. complete every missing semantic decision before planning;
4. add the smallest required plan record and directly named lowering method;
5. produce the same complete artifact set through the direct route;
6. inspect differences, compile both routes, and run the existing assertions;
7. update checklist evidence only after direct-route parity is proven.

Generated source is diagnostic evidence, not a byte-for-byte golden. Backend
temporary names and equivalent control flow may differ, but ABI, conversion,
ownership, cleanup, call order, and artifact requirements must remain proven.

During this migration the full real-library BLAS/LAPACK wrapper corpus is
excluded locally and in CI until final cutover. General native-bundle coverage
remains active.

## Staged Walkthrough

`tools/wrapper_plan_staged_walkthrough.py` is the maintained hand-inspection
path. It shows only the source/contract entry, policy completion, plan creation,
a direct edit, direct generation, artifact inspection, build, and runtime use:

```python
module = ...
complete_semantic_policies(module)

plan = WrapperPlanner().build(module)
namespace = next(item for item in plan.namespaces if item.python_path == ())
function = namespace.functions[0]
function.bridge.native_name = "SUB_R8"

binding = CBindingGenerator()
bridge = FortranBridgeGenerator()
print(function.arguments[0].binding.optional_mode)
print(function.arguments[0].bridge.optional_mode)

artifacts = WrapperCodeGenerator(
    c_generator=binding,
    fortran_generator=bridge,
).generate(plan)

# inspect generated files
# build and run
```

It does not expose standalone validation. Printed plan inspection uses the
actual namespace, owner, and completed action records. The backend visitors
make the corresponding explicit action matches visible in their typed lowering
helpers.

## Required Evidence

Focused tests must prove:

- `WrapperPlanner.build(module)` returns a directly mutable plan;
- direct edits to binding and bridge views change the relevant generated C and
  Fortran source;
- `WrapperCodeGenerator.generate(plan)` freezes the exact consumed plan;
- module visitors recursively include generated function nodes;
- function visitors recursively include argument, result, and lifecycle nodes;
- directly named backend lowering methods cover every supported plan action;
- unsupported combinations fail explicitly;
- source printers freeze backend module nodes;
- generated artifacts remain editable until build consumption, which freezes
  them;
- source and semantic-`.pyi` entries preserve compiled runtime parity; and
- backend lowering does not reconstruct semantic policy.

Use package-export inspection and focused migration checks to prove removal of
obsolete internal representations; do not preserve tests whose only assertion
is that a removed API is absent.

## Recovered Roadmap Scope

The detailed migration queue below is retained from the original roadmap. The
obsolete Phase 0-2 emitter/fragment architecture is replaced by the simplified
direct-plan checklist later in this file; all later semantic lanes, matrix rows,
verification gates, and completion records remain explicit.

## Existing Wrapper Suite As The Migration Queue

`tests/wrapper` is the behavioral source and final acceptance suite for this
migration. Migrate its existing generation units one by one; do not create a
parallel wrapper suite or new native source fixtures merely to make the new
route easier to exercise.

- Phase 0A adds a maintained migration matrix to this file covering every
  Python test node under `tests/wrapper`. Each row records whether the test
  generates a wrapper, the source/contract generation unit it uses, its
  relevant feature lanes, and one status:
  `not-applicable`, `deferred-real-library`, `legacy`, `dual-route`, or
  `wrapper-plan`.
- Existing source files, contract fixtures, build helpers, runtime assertions,
  failure assertions, and ABI assertions are reused as written whenever they
  already cover the migrated behavior. Do not copy their behavior into a new
  test with a smaller invented source.
- A new native source or contract fixture is allowed only when the audit proves
  that accepted production behavior has no existing test. Record that coverage
  gap and its owning semantic lane here before adding the fixture; migration
  convenience is not sufficient justification.
- Whole-generation-unit routing still applies. An existing test moves to
  `dual-route` only when every runtime-required feature in its module is
  supported. If a nominally scalar fixture also contains results, strings,
  arrays, decorators, module state, or classes, leave it on the legacy route
  until those lanes are complete rather than carving out a narrower fixture.
- Dual-route parity reuses the same existing fixture and assertion function for
  legacy and wrapper-plan builds through internal test orchestration. Do not
  add a public route flag, duplicate the behavioral assertions, or require
  byte-identical generated source.
- Once parity passes and production eligibility is widened, that existing test
  moves to `wrapper-plan`. Keep deliberate legacy execution only in the
  migration parity harness until final cutover.
- The final target is not merely that `tests/wrapper` passes. Every test in the
  suite must be represented in the migration matrix, and every test that
  generates a runtime wrapper must use the wrapper-plan route after cutover.
  Tests that only inspect documentation, layout, parsing, or `.pyi` generation
  may be `not-applicable` but must still pass.
- During active migration, every local and GitHub Actions pytest invocation
  excludes
  `tests/wrapper/fortran/real_libraries/test_real_blas_lapack.py`. Mark its BLAS
  and LAPACK rows `deferred-real-library`; do not use either corpus for lane
  parity or general migration verification. General native-bundle tests in
  `test_stage7_native_bundles.py` remain active because they test linker/build
  mechanics independently of the full BLAS/LAPACK corpora.

### Wrapper Test Migration Matrix

Matrix rows use pytest selector patterns. A row ending in `::*` covers every
collected test node in that Python file when all nodes share the same
generation classification. A row ending in `[*]` covers the parametrized nodes
for that test function. The structural layout test expands these selectors
against live `python3 -m pytest --collect-only -q tests/wrapper` output, so a
new wrapper test node must either match an existing row intentionally or add a
new row here before later implementation starts.

Statuses have the meanings defined above: `legacy` still uses the current
`semantic_ir_to_codegen_ast()` route, `dual-route` runs the same generation
unit and runtime assertions through both implementations, `wrapper-plan` uses
only `WrapperPlan -> WrapperCodeGenerator`, `not-applicable` does not generate
a runtime wrapper, and `deferred-real-library` is reserved for the full BLAS
and LAPACK corpus until Phase 12.

#### Current Wrapper Route Counts

These are collected pytest-node counts, not matrix-row counts. The structural
layout test derives them from live `tests/wrapper` collection and fails if this
summary, the exhaustive matrix, and the test tree disagree.

| Status | Collected nodes |
| --- | ---: |
| `wrapper-plan` | 349 |
| `dual-route` | 0 |
| `legacy` | 0 |
| `not-applicable` | 75 |
| `deferred-real-library` | 0 |

#### Recorded Route Progression

This history keeps phase movement visible instead of replacing the previous
snapshot with only the latest totals. Phase 2D moved all 17 dual-route nodes
and 44 legacy nodes to production plan routing, then added two parametrized
plan-route nodes. Phase 2E adds two scalar-only parity nodes, and Phase 2F adds
one isolated direct-return plus hidden-output scalar aggregation node. The
original mixed integration nodes retain their real array/string/object
blockers.

| Proven checkpoint | `wrapper-plan` | `dual-route` | `legacy` | `not-applicable` | `deferred-real-library` | Total |

| Phase 8H failure, qualified-type, and typed-value closure | 222 | 5 | 123 | 95 | 2 | 447 |
| Phase 11 cross-cutting suite completion | 344 | 0 | 0 | 95 | 2 | 441 |
| Phase 12 canonical cutover | 346 | 0 | 0 | 95 | 0 | 441 |

Migration is complete only when `legacy`, `dual-route`, and
`deferred-real-library` are all zero. At that point every runtime-generating
node must be `wrapper-plan`; `not-applicable` may remain only for tests that do
not generate a wrapper. Until then, moving a node from `legacy` to `dual-route`
records proven parity, and moving it from `dual-route` to `wrapper-plan`
records final removal of its legacy execution.

#### Complete Route Ledger

For a `legacy` row, the feature-lane column identifies what still blocks the
new route. For `dual-route` and `wrapper-plan` rows, it identifies the behavior
already covered by the new generator.

## Incremental Protocol

For each lane:

1. Select and run an existing passing `tests/wrapper` generation unit through
   the legacy route. Retain and inspect its complete generated artifact set.
2. Trace the current lowering, binding, bridge, node/API-model, printer,
   runtime-helper, and build paths that produced those artifacts, and record the
   observed behavior and existing tests that make them the migration baseline.
3. Expand this checklist with the lane's exact scope, exclusions, source-path
   baseline, required backend behavior, plan fields, and validation invariants.
4. Complete every policy field required by the lane in post-IR policy
   completion; do not start its planner while semantic decisions remain
   scattered or implicit.
5. Implement the lane's hierarchical plan records, planner visitors,
   ABI/handoff specs, generator-owned structural checks, directly named backend
   lowering methods, source-printer support, and support-report coverage.
6. Implement the minimum dependency-closed backend slice in
   `x2py.wrapper_codegen`: copy small suitable pieces, rewrite oversized legacy
   classes as minimal equivalents, and add only the intermediate tests required
   by the contract above.
7. Generate the plan from policy-completed semantic IR, invoke the directly
   named binding and bridge lowering methods, assemble complete backend modules,
   and print complete internal artifacts.
8. Compare the new generated artifacts with the retained legacy artifacts and
   explain every material difference before compilation.
9. Compile the internal artifacts before changing production route selection.
10. Run the same eligible existing fixtures and assertions through both routes
   and compare compiled runtime behavior, failure paths, native-call mapping,
   and artifact requirements.
11. Extend the whole-module support predicate so a generation unit uses the
   wrapper-plan route only when all its elements belong to completed lanes.
   Keep the old route for generation units containing unsupported lanes.
12. Update every affected `tests/wrapper` migration-matrix row and mark the lane
    complete only when the reused parity tests pass and every intentional
    difference from the baseline is separately documented.

Do not start a later lane by guessing. Each lane must define the handoff specs
and consistency checks it needs.

## Mandatory Expansion Gate For Broad Phases

Phases 5 through 10 are roadmap envelopes, not complete implementation
checklists. Before implementation starts on one of them, update this file and
split that phase into dependency-ordered sub-lanes. The expansion must be based
on an audit of the live semantic models, completed policies, existing
bridge/binding behavior, decorators, and focused wrapper tests.

Each expanded sub-lane must state:

- the exact included and excluded semantic cases;
- the completed-policy fields it consumes and any decisions that still need to
  move into post-IR policy completion;
- plan records, action keys, handoff specs, native-call slots, lifecycle phases,
  and required generated artifacts;
- binding and bridge handler names and which backend-local helper values they
  may create;
- validation invariants across Python input/result, binding handoff, bridge
  handoff, native call, writeback, cleanup, ownership, and release;
- the whole-module support-predicate change that makes the sub-lane eligible;
- existing `tests/wrapper` nodes that cover the sub-lane, their migration-matrix
  status changes, and dual-route parity evidence against the legacy route;
- the exact legacy source path and consumed behavior for every isolated
  primitive, whether it is copied or rewritten, its minimal dependency closure,
  baseline evidence, and a reason for every behavior with no legacy source;
- dependencies on earlier lanes and the legacy behavior that can be removed
  when the sub-lane is complete.

Do not mark a broad phase complete from its current envelope items. Mark its
expanded sub-lanes individually, then close the phase only after all live cases
in its audited support matrix are either migrated or explicitly removed from
the product contract.

## Dependency-Ordered Checklist

### Foundation and semantic authority

- [x] Establish the isolated `x2py.wrapper_codegen` package boundary and
  visitor infrastructure.
- [x] Complete the first primitive lane in general wrapper policy before
  planning, including native-call order, result projection, ownership, and
  lifecycle facts.
- [x] Build editable `ModulePlan`, `FunctionPlan`, transfer, result, ABI,
  native-slot, and lifecycle records from completed wrapper policy.
- [x] Refactor each cross-boundary owner into explicit binding and bridge child
  plans, including module/function/result/lifecycle scope as well as arguments.
- [x] Remove plan-owned method names and handler registries; add typed
  datatype-family facts required by direct lowering.
- [x] Keep structural plan validation private to `WrapperCodeGenerator`, with
  no planner-time validation or standalone validator class, and verify every
  listed invariant after direct plan edits.

### Direct generator boundary

- [x] Change `WrapperCodeGenerator.generate` to consume only `ModulePlan`,
  freeze it, validate it, validate lowering support, recursively generate
  backend nodes, print them, and return artifacts directly.
- [x] Implement recursive `CBindingGenerator` synthesis of complete C modules,
  headers, and functions from plan nodes.
- [x] Implement recursive `FortranBridgeGenerator` synthesis of complete
  Fortran modules and functions from plan nodes.
- [x] Replace plan-selected method names with directly named backend lowering
  methods selected by the visible `_lower_{subject}_{action.value}` rule.
- [x] Ensure backend node printers, artifact construction, and build
  consumption retain their distinct freezing boundaries.

### Scalar parity and route evidence

- [x] Replay the existing scalar source and semantic-`.pyi` baseline through
  the direct generator and compare generated artifacts and runtime behavior.
- [x] Update the staged walkthrough to use only plan editing and the public
  generator boundary.
- [x] Retire superseded internal representations, their package exports,
  orchestration, validation, documentation, and focused tests.
- [x] Run focused wrapper-codegen and pipeline tests; the walkthrough for both
  supported entry choices where practical; `tests/wrapper` excluding LAPACK;
  documentation checks; `git diff --check`; the required static-analysis suite;
  and `tools/check_wrapper_codegen_complexity.py`.

## Phase 3 — Scalar Inout, Optional, And Descriptor-Like Scalars

Scope: scalar copy-in/copy-out, optional arguments, present-but-null descriptor
values, and scalar allocatable/pointer descriptor boundaries.

Phase 3 legacy replay audit:

- `foptional_fixed.f` uses one nullable value pointer at the Bind-C ABI.
  Omission and explicit `None` both pass a null pointer because both mean that
  the ordinary optional dummy is absent; a concrete scalar uses call-local
  storage, and the bridge branches on `c_associated(...)` before calling the
  native function with or without the optional keyword.
- The existing optional allocatable-scalar contract uses two independent ABI
  pointers. The value pointer is null for explicit `None`, while the presence
  pointer is non-null for both `None` and a concrete value. Omission leaves both
  null. The bridge therefore distinguishes absent, present-unallocated, and
  present-with-value states without inferring presence from the value pointer.
- Immutable scalar replacement uses copy-in storage, native mutation of that
  storage, copy-out to a new Python scalar, and scope-owned stack cleanup. The
  caller's original NumPy scalar remains unchanged. The audit found no existing
  runtime wrapper test for this primitive-scalar `Returns["argument", T]`
  contract, so `test_scalar_writeback_plan.py` is the recorded coverage-gap
  fixture for this lane.
- The first legacy replay of that coverage gap exposed a duplicate declaration
  of the mutable scalar result. The legacy bridge now promotes the copy-in
  temporary to the Bind-C function result and removes it from the ordinary
  local-declaration set. Both routes compile, and incompatible Python values
  fail with `TypeError` before the native call. Stack temporaries and local
  allocatable descriptors require no explicit release action; their procedure
  scope owns cleanup on normal return.

The Phase 3 plan records optional mode, nullable value and presence handoffs,
and four ordered scalar replacement phases: `copy_in`, `native_mutation`,
`copy_out`, and `cleanup`. Generator preflight requires the complete phase set,
an existing source handoff, the correct binding/bridge owner for each phase,
and a Python result target for copy-out. Forced whole-module route selection
accepts these completed lanes after the dual-route evidence below. Automatic
production selection still remains on the legacy route under the independent
GIL parity deferral recorded for Phase 2D.

- [x] Audit and record the legacy copy-in/out, optional presence, nullable
  scalar descriptor, cleanup, and failure-path behavior for this lane.
- [x] Add or rewrite only the additional optional/descriptor nodes, API
  primitives, local-state helpers, and printer cases required by this lane,
  with baseline tests.
- [x] Represent copy-in, native mutation, copy-out, and cleanup as explicit
  writeback phases.
- [x] Preserve the three-state optional rule: omitted argument, explicit `None`,
  and present concrete value are distinct when the native ABI needs them.
- [x] Represent scalar descriptor presence tokens and nullable value handoffs in
  the plan.
- [x] Validate that a writeback consumes an existing binding/bridge handoff and
  writes to a Python-visible target or result slot.
- [x] Emit and print complete inout/optional/descriptor-capable modules
  internally, then compile and compare both routes for all three presence
  states, mutation, writeback, cleanup, ABI, and failures.
- [x] Widen whole-module route eligibility to this lane only after parity, and
  complete it before moving arrays or handles to the plan path.

## Phase 4 — Scalar Module Variables

Scope: scalar module variables. Derived-type fields remain in Phases 8 and 9
because their wrapper instance, owner, and property lifecycle must already be
represented before field access can use the plan route.

Phase 4 legacy replay audit:

- `fmodule_vars_f90.f90` establishes the ordinary scalar state contract. Its
  legacy bridge emits value-returning getters and value-argument setters;
  binding accessors run with the GIL held, aliases route to the same native
  storage, deletion fails, and contract initializers call the native setter at
  import. A `parameter` is instead copied into the Python module dictionary, so
  rebinding it is local to that module object and never mutates native storage.
  This whole source remains legacy because it also owns `rgb_color` and derived
  module objects from later phases.
- The scalar subset of `fscalar_descriptors_f90` establishes nullable
  allocatable and pointer reads. The legacy bridge returns null for absent
  storage or allocates and copies one detached scalar; the binding converts the
  copy, frees it, and rejects descriptor replacement. Its whole source cannot
  migrate in Phase 4 because it also contains nullable snapshot-result forms
  from a later lane. Allocation failure is deliberately injected with
  `X2PY_WRAPPER_FAIL_ALLOC` and preserves the legacy null/`None` surface.
- No existing generation unit contained only the already completed scalar
  function lanes plus every Phase 4 getter, setter, constant, descriptor,
  initialization, reload, and failure behavior. The bounded
  `test_scalar_module_variable_plan.py` whole-module fixture records that
  coverage gap; it contains no strings, arrays, classes, or later-phase owner.

The plan keeps only completed typed facts: Python names, getter and setter
actions, initializer or constant value, datatype family, native name/module,
native assignment, descriptor kind, and handoff roles. Both backends invoke
directly named lowering methods with matching subject/action suffixes wherever
their behavior is shared; datatype and descriptor facts stay method inputs.
The generator validates the complete frozen plan before either backend emits
anything, including binding/bridge getter agreement and the rule that a Python
write-through setter must have a compatible bridge setter role. Forced
whole-module selection now accepts `scalar-module-variables`; automatic
production selection remains independently deferred by the Phase 2D GIL gate.

- [x] Audit and record the legacy scalar module-variable getter, setter,
  rejected replacement, module initialization, and attribute-routing behavior.
- [x] Add or rewrite only the additional module/type nodes, getter/setter API
  primitives, initialization nodes, and printer cases required by this lane,
  with baseline tests.
- [x] Represent getter behavior, setter exposure, native setter assignment, and
  rejected replacement behavior in module-variable plans.
- [x] Add binding actions for Python attribute get/set around scalar values.
- [x] Add bridge actions for scalar module-variable read/write.
- [x] Validate getter/setter pair consistency: a Python setter cannot exist
  without a compatible bridge setter handoff.
- [x] Keep ordinary Python module-name rebinding semantics separate from native
  module-variable storage.
- [x] Emit and print complete module-variable-capable modules internally, then
  compile and compare both routes for get/set behavior, rejection paths,
  initialization, cleanup, ABI, and generated artifacts.
- [x] Widen whole-module route eligibility to scalar module variables only after
  that parity evidence passes.

### Phase 3/4 whole-unit namespace correction

The post-Phase 4 review found that scalar lowering itself matched the legacy
route, but the parity helper unwrapped a sole native child module before making
assertions. That hid a public-surface difference: the legacy route retained
Fortran modules as Python child namespaces while the plan route flattened their
members at the extension root. The support analyzer also accepted colliding
procedures from separate native modules and allowed the failure to reach the
Fortran compiler.

This correction is part of the completed scalar foundation rather than a new
datatype lane:

- [x] Add a concise `NamespacePlan` beneath `ModulePlan`; place functions and
  variables in namespace nodes instead of flattening them into the module.
- [x] Complete Python export paths in post-IR export policy, including
  namespace-local keyword and collision fixes, then mechanically group plan
  owners by those paths without reconstructing namespace policy in either
  backend.
- [x] Generate root, child, and nested Python modules while keeping native
  module imports and generated bridge symbols unambiguous.
- [x] Support ordinary scalar subroutines with no projected result through the
  existing native call plus Python `None` result path.
- [x] Reject duplicate Python exports and generated symbols before either
  backend emits source.
- [x] Use one visible lowering naming rule in both backends:
  `_lower_argument_<optional-mode>`, `_lower_result_<codegen-action>`,
  `_lower_writeback_<codegen-action>`, `_lower_module_getter_<getter-action>`,
  and `_lower_module_setter_<setter-action>`. Do not store method-name strings
  in the plan or hide these selections in backend dictionaries.
- [x] Remove scalar prefixes from general wrapper concepts, including the
  function, argument, result, native-slot, lifecycle, node, and printer policy
  surfaces. Retain scalar naming only for permanently scalar-specific ABI type
  facts and actions.
- [x] Update the staged walkthrough to print the namespace tree, typed actions,
  and the directly corresponding binding and bridge method names.
- [x] Compile both routes from the existing complete
  `contract_mixed_module_external.f90`, `contract_import_graph.f90`,
  `contract_multi_module.f90`, `contract_standalone_only.f90`, and
  `contract_same_name.f90` fixtures; compare the real extension root and child
  namespaces without `_sole_native_module` normalization.

## Phase 2D — Native Call Runtime Envelope

This is the next dependency-closed migration lane. Complete it before Phase 5
so the already proven scalar generation units can move from temporary
`dual-route` evidence to production `wrapper-plan` routing instead of adding
more datatype lanes behind the same runtime gate.

Scope: the binding-owned runtime envelope around an otherwise completed native
call. This phase includes default GIL release, explicit `@hold_gil`, and native
status/message projection through `@raises(...)`. Status projection is included
because the existing `fruntime_policy_f90` generation unit tests it together
with both GIL modes and whole-generation-unit routing cannot split that module.

Excluded from this phase:

- strings, arrays, descriptors, derived types, and callbacks, which remain in
  their datatype or callback phases;
- callback re-entry and callback exception/abort behavior, which remain in
  Phase 10;
- OpenMP array execution and Makefile-specific behavior, which remain blocked
  by the array and cross-cutting build lanes;
- general Python exception translation that is not selected by a completed
  native status policy.

The existing legacy/runtime oracle is
`tests/wrapper/fortran/runtime_behavior/test_runtime_policies.py` in both its
source-driven and semantic-`.pyi`-driven forms. It proves that an ordinary
native pause releases the GIL, `@hold_gil` keeps it held, successful status
returns produce the declared Python result, failing status returns raise the
selected exception with the native message, and emitted C places
`Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS` / `Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS` only around eligible native
calls. `test_recursive_native_runtime_calls` is the scalar regression unit to
run after the call envelope works. Do not use the OpenMP or callback fixtures
as the first parity unit.

The plan and generators must follow these boundaries:

- Post-IR policy completion owns `hold_gil` and the complete native status
  error decision, including status source, message source, success value, and
  Python exception kind. The planner only projects those completed facts.
- Keep the runtime facts concise and function-owned. Extend the existing
  binding-facing function plan rather than adding a second function plan or a
  backend dispatcher table. The bridge continues to lower native call slots
  and result storage mechanically; it does not decide GIL or Python exception
  policy.
- Argument parsing and conversion, Python result construction, status/message
  conversion, exception creation, writeback, and Python-owned cleanup always
  run with the GIL held. For the default policy, release the GIL immediately
  before the bridge call and reacquire it immediately after that call. For
  `hold_gil=True`, emit no release region.
- Perform status evaluation and raise the selected Python exception only after
  the GIL has been reacquired. Validate before emission that every status and
  message projection names an existing native result slot with a compatible
  completed handoff.
- Use directly named lowering methods that follow the existing visible naming
  rule. Do not infer runtime policy from result types, function names, emitted
  locals, or the presence of status-like native arguments.

The completed legacy audit found one binding-owned envelope in both oracle
builds. The legacy binding parsed and converted Python inputs with the GIL
held, emitted `Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS` immediately before the bridge call and
`Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS` immediately after it by default, and omitted both
macros for `@hold_gil`. Only after reacquiring the GIL did it convert hidden
status/message outputs, compare status with `success`, construct
`RuntimeError`, suppress those policy outputs from the declared Python result,
and decref converted result objects on both the failure and success paths. A
missing or incompatible status/message name was previously rediscovered from
raw decorator dictionaries and result datatypes in `ir2ast` and the legacy C
binding; Phase 2D moved that decision to typed post-IR completion and left the
legacy route as a dispatch consumer for rollback parity.

The direct plan route now preserves that ordering with explicit released-call
and held-call lowering methods. Its fixed native message handoff is
bridge-owned null-terminated storage that the binding converts and frees after
the GIL is reacquired. Generated symbol spelling differs from the legacy
artifacts, but the same source and edited-`.pyi` concurrency, exception,
cleanup, and runtime assertions pass. Production cutover also reused the
existing rendered-artifact build path for inferred native module include
directories, native library directories, `.pyi` manifests, verbose timing,
and scalar external explicit interfaces; no legacy retry was added.

- [x] Audit and record the exact legacy GIL release/hold region, status/message
  projection, exception construction, result suppression, cleanup, and failure
  behavior from both existing runtime-policy tests.
- [x] Complete the native status error decision in post-IR policy before
  planning; retain the already completed `hold_gil` fact as its single source
  of truth.
- [x] Extend the concise function plan with only the binding-facing runtime
  facts needed for GIL and status-error lowering, and validate all referenced
  native result slots before either backend emits source.
- [x] Add direct binding lowering for the released-call and held-call envelopes
  plus post-call status projection. Keep the bridge call and result-slot
  lowering on their existing paths.
- [x] Replay both source and semantic-`.pyi` forms of
  `test_runtime_policies.py` through legacy and wrapper-plan routes using the
  same concurrency, exception, artifact, and generated-C assertions.
- [x] Run `test_recursive_native_runtime_calls` through the wrapper-plan route
  as the scalar recursion regression; leave OpenMP and callbacks in their
  later lanes.
- [x] After dual-route parity passes, remove the blanket Phase 2D production
  deferral. Let whole-generation-unit support select `wrapper-plan` only for
  units whose feature lanes are complete; do not add fallback or per-function
  mixed routing.
- [x] Move the eligible scalar matrix rows from `dual-route` or `legacy` to
  `wrapper-plan`, update the live route counts, and prove their default builds
  no longer invoke `semantic_ir_to_codegen_ast()`.
- [x] Finish this phase only when the production `wrapper-plan` count is
  nonzero and the already completed scalar baseline no longer depends on the
  legacy route outside deliberate rollback diagnostics.

## Phase 2E — Scalar Boundary Completion and Test Isolation — Complete

Complete the scalar public boundary before stopping this migration lane. This
phase does not begin strings or arrays. It separates scalar evidence from
mixed generation units so whole-unit routing cannot hide whether one scalar
policy is implemented.

Scope: every supported primitive scalar kind; ordinary Python scalar values;
`Addr(Arg(i))` call-local address projection; projected scalar copy-in/copy-out;
caller-owned rank-zero NumPy storage spelled `T[()]`; caller-supplied integer
raw addresses spelled `Addr(T)`; and visible or hidden scalar `in`, `out`, and
`inout` behavior. For a mixed native fixture whose declarations cannot be
safely sliced, add a small distinctly named scalar-only native test routine
that preserves the policy decision under test.

The boundary contract remains:

- `T` accepts a Python/NumPy scalar value. When native code only reads it, the
  wrapper converts into call-local storage. When native code writes through an
  address projection and the contract projects `Returns["name", T]`, the
  wrapper performs copy-in, native mutation, and copy-out to a replacement
  Python scalar; the caller's immutable scalar object is not mutated.
- `T[()]` accepts a rank-zero NumPy array with exactly the declared dtype. The
  wrapper validates caller storage and passes its data address; native `out` or
  `inout` mutation remains visible in that same array and the Python call
  returns `None` unless the contract declares another result.
- `Addr(T)` accepts an integer address such as `array.ctypes.data`. The wrapper
  converts it to a raw pointer and forwards that same address without copying
  or owning the pointee. Mutation is therefore observed through caller-owned
  storage.
- `@native_call(...)` controls only native slot order and value/address/result
  projection. It does not change which Python representation (`T`, `T[()]`, or
  `Addr(T)`) the declared argument accepts.
- Use one necessary-copy rule. For interoperable scalar replacement, the
  binding's converted C scalar is the copy-in storage and the bridge passes
  that same storage directly to the native routine; after mutation the binding
  converts it once to the Python replacement. `c_f_pointer` association for
  `T[()]` or `Addr(T)` is not a data copy. A bridge-local data copy is allowed
  only when the native representation actually changes, such as descriptor,
  string-buffer, or ownership-snapshot construction.
- Enforce that rule with a completed `BridgeDataAction` on every argument,
  result, and native-call output slot. `DIRECT_TRANSFER` reuses boundary
  storage, `ASSOCIATE_VIEW` may create only a non-owning native view,
  `COPY_REPRESENTATION` is the sole bridge data-copy permission and requires a
  non-empty policy reason, and `BLOCKED` keeps the whole generation unit off
  the plan route. A non-copying action carrying a copy reason is also invalid.
  New array, string, or object support must complete this fact before route
  eligibility is widened.

Excluded: simultaneous multiple-result tuple assembly; rank-positive arrays;
strings including fixed status buffers except for already completed Phase 2D
status projection; derived types; callbacks; and any compatibility fallback to
the legacy generator.

- [x] Record scalar-only tests separately from mixed array/string/derived
  generation units in the route ledger; use copied minimal native routines
  when fixture declarations are coupled.
- [x] Cover every primitive scalar kind exercised by the scalar runtime suite
  through the direct registry and both binding/bridge generators.
- [x] Add direct named binding and bridge lowering for rank-zero numeric/logical
  storage using the completed `SCALAR_STORAGE` and `PASS_STORAGE_ADDRESS`
  decisions; validate dtype, rank zero, and writability before the native call.
- [x] Add direct named binding and bridge lowering for primitive raw addresses
  using the completed `RAW_ADDRESS` and `PASS_RAW_ADDRESS` decisions; accept an
  integer address and forward it without copy or ownership inference.
- [x] Prove isolated scalar input, hidden output, copy-in/copy-out `inout`,
  caller-storage `out`/`inout`, and raw-address `out`/`inout` behavior through
  compiled legacy/direct-plan parity where applicable.
- [x] Prove scalar copy-in/copy-out reuses one binding local and does not add a
  redundant bridge-local value copy.
- [x] Prove plan validation rejects an unexplained bridge copy, a copy reason
  on a non-copying path, and any still-blocked bridge data action.
- [x] Prove isolated `@native_call` argument mapping, including `Addr(Arg(i))`
  and hidden `Return(...)` slots, without arrays determining route selection.
- [x] Move only proven scalar-only nodes to `wrapper-plan`, update collected
  route counts, and leave the original mixed integration nodes on their real
  datatype blockers.

## Phase 2F — Multiple Scalar Result Assembly — Complete

This is result aggregation, not another scalar boundary representation. The
first isolated oracle is the `with_scalar` policy from
`test_output_arguments.py`: one direct primitive scalar function return plus
one hidden primitive scalar output, assembled into a Python tuple in declared
result order. Keep it separate from arrays, strings, derived types, and native
handles before widening the plan route.

For source-derived contracts, an ordinary non-descriptor `intent(out)` scalar
hidden by Python result projection still selects `PASS_CALL_LOCAL_ADDRESS`
even when no edited `.pyi` `Addr(...)` spelling exists. The hidden-result
projection is itself the completed semantic fact that requires writable
call-local native storage; the binding and bridge must not rediscover that ABI
rule. Rank-zero allocatable/pointer descriptor outputs retain the distinct
Phase 7H descriptor transport and are not rewritten as ordinary addresses.

The completed representation is an ordered `FunctionWrapperPolicy.results`
tuple and an ordered `FunctionPlan.results` tuple. Each Python-visible result
has its own `ResultPolicy` and `ResultPlan`, including its binding consumer and
`result_position`. A direct native function return has
`source_kind="direct_return"` and no native-call slot. A hidden output has
`source_kind="hidden_output"` and references the exact same mutable
`NativeCallSlotPlan` stored in `FunctionPlan.native_call_slots`. The bridge
uses the sole direct result, when present, to select its function result and
passes every hidden result through its completed output-address slot. It does
not assemble Python results.

After the native call, the binding converts each result from its completed
source role exactly once. One result is returned directly; two or more are
assembled into a Python tuple in ascending `result_position`. Tuple allocation,
reference transfer, and failure cleanup are binding-local emission details,
not semantic policy. Before either backend emits source, validation requires
result positions to cover `0..N-1` exactly once, at most one direct result,
every hidden result to share its function native-call slot, and every
non-status native output slot to have exactly one binding result consumer.
Phase 2F does not combine these consumers with projected argument writeback;
that broader aggregation remains blocked until it receives its own completed
policy.

- [x] Add a scalar-only copied native routine and contract for a direct return
  plus hidden scalar `Return(...)` slot.
- [x] Represent every Python result as an explicit binding consumer while
  preserving the bridge's direct-return and output-address ABI roles.
- [x] Validate contiguous result positions and reject unclaimed outputs before
  either backend emits source.
- [x] Prove compiled legacy/direct-plan parity, then update the route counts.

## Phase 5 — Strings

Scope: non-descriptor scalar character values, fixed-length strings, assumed-
length call inputs, immutable replacement, mutable rank-zero byte storage, and
raw fixed-length character addresses. Character arrays remain in Phases 6 and
7; allocatable or pointer scalar character values remain in Phase 7; character
fields remain in Phases 8 and 9; character callbacks remain in Phase 10.

The legacy wrapper is the behavioral oracle for this phase. In particular,
`CPythonBindingGenerator._convert_python_string_value_argument()` and
`_convert_python_string_storage_argument()` define Python conversion,
validation, allocation, and writeback behavior, while
`FortranToCBridgeGenerator._build_string_argument()`,
`_build_string_storage_argument()`, `_convert_raw_string_argument()`, and
`_convert_string_result()` define the bridge representation. The public
contract and observable oracle are
`docs/user/guide/fortran-wrapper.md`, `docs/user/guide/data-types.md`,
`docs/user/reference/semantic-pyi-format.md`,
`tests/wrapper/fortran/strings/test_character_arguments.py`, and
`tests/wrapper/fortran/strings/test_character_edge_cases.py`. Direct-plan
lowering may use different temporary names or an equivalent internal C ABI,
but it must preserve the legacy Python behavior, native argument order,
character payload, length, ownership, cleanup, and result projection.

Strings use the same completed-policy and planning pipeline as the other
rank-zero scalar families:

```text
ArgumentPolicy -> ArgumentTransferPlan -> NativeCallSlotPlan
ResultPolicy -> ResultPlan
LifecyclePolicy -> LifecycleActionPlan
```

Do not add a parallel string plan hierarchy or plan-owned handler names.
Numeric and logical primitive families share registry-backed lowering because
their generated structure is the same. `DatatypeFamily.STRING` dispatches to
its own directly named binding and bridge lowering methods because character
conversion and ABI structure differ. The existing `STRING_VALUE`,
`STRING_STORAGE`, `PASS_CALL_LOCAL_ADDRESS`, `PASS_STORAGE_ADDRESS`,
`PASS_RAW_ADDRESS`, and generic codegen/lifecycle actions remain authoritative;
add a new typed action only if those completed actions cannot identify a real
semantic choice.

Every string argument plan records the completed fixed positive character
length or the absence of a fixed length. The binding-to-bridge handoff records
both the payload address and encoded payload length when the bridge needs both;
this is an ABI fact in the existing argument transfer, not a new planning
stage. A fixed `String[n]` Python value must encode to exactly `n` bytes. A
plain `String` input carries its runtime UTF-8 byte length. Embedded NUL is
rejected before the native call. The bridge may copy bytes into Fortran
character storage only when `BridgeDataAction.COPY_REPRESENTATION` and its
non-empty policy reason were completed before planning.

The phase is split into the following dependency-ordered sub-lanes.

### Phase 5A — Required Read-Only String Values

Included: required rank-zero `String[n]` and `String` Python `str` inputs;
default character, kind `1`, and `c_char`; fixed-length exact encoded-byte
validation; assumed-length runtime payload size; embedded-NUL rejection; and
primitive scalar or void results already supported by earlier phases.

Excluded: writable inputs, projected replacement, optional strings, string
results, mutable `String[n][()]` storage, raw `Addr(String[n])`, arrays,
allocatable/deferred results, fields, and callbacks.

Completed policy must provide `ObjectKind.STRING`,
`PythonBarrierAction.STRING_VALUE`,
`NativeBarrierAction.PASS_CALL_LOCAL_ADDRESS`,
`CodegenAction.CALL_LOCAL_INPUT`, `StorageMode.STACK`, required presence,
`BridgeDataAction.COPY_REPRESENTATION`, and the reason that C UTF-8 bytes are
materialized as Fortran character storage. Planning projects those facts into
the ordinary argument/native-slot records. The C binding method
`_lower_argument_required_string_value()` validates `str`, extracts UTF-8 plus
byte length, rejects embedded NUL, and enforces a fixed length when present.
The Fortran bridge method `_lower_argument_required_string_value()` receives
the payload address and length, associates a byte view, copies it into one
backend-local character temporary, and passes that temporary in the completed
native-call position.

Validation requires a string-value Python action, call-local-address native
action, character-buffer handoff, one matching payload-length role, required
presence, no projected result, and a justified representation copy. Whole-unit
eligibility widens only for generation units containing this lane plus already
completed scalar/result/runtime lanes. Replay uses the existing
`fstrings_f90` native object and contract package with a reduced entry that
exports only existing read-only scalar string procedures; both routes run the
same fixed/assumed-length, kind, NumPy-string-scalar, wrong-length, and embedded
NUL assertions. The mixed original string nodes remain `legacy` because their
units also contain string results, writable strings, arrays, and allocatables.

- [x] Complete Phase 5A policy, ordinary plan projection, validation, named C
  and Fortran lowering, reduced-entry dual-route runtime parity, support
  predicate, and migration-ledger evidence.

### Phase 5B — Fixed-Length String Results And Hidden Outputs

Included: direct fixed-length scalar character results and fixed-length hidden
`intent(out)` results, including trailing blanks. The binding receives a
NUL-terminated C-owned copy, converts the full payload to a Python-owned
`str`, and releases the temporary exactly once. The bridge allocates and fills
that copy only through completed `COPY_REPRESENTATION` policy. Deferred-length
and nullable allocatable or pointer results remain in Phase 7 because their
runtime length and allocation state are descriptor lifecycle facts, not
scalar-string conversion facts.

Both forms reuse the ordinary ordered `ResultPolicy -> ResultPlan` path and
record the fixed positive `character_length` on the result. A direct native
function result has `source_kind="direct_return"`,
`CodegenAction.COPY_OUT`, no native-call slot, and a bridge function result of
`type(c_ptr)`. The bridge first receives the native value in backend-local
`character(kind=c_char, len=n)` storage, then allocates `n + 1` bytes through
the existing `x2py_malloc` interface, copies all `n` characters, appends
`c_null_char`, and returns the pointer. A hidden output has
`source_kind="hidden_output"`, `CodegenAction.COPY_OUT`,
`NativeBarrierAction.PASS_CALL_LOCAL_ADDRESS`, and references the exact same
fixed-length `NativeCallSlotPlan` used by the function. Its existing output
slot receives native character storage, then performs the same justified
allocation and copy after the native call.

In both cases, binding lowering checks for a null allocation, converts the
NUL-terminated UTF-8 payload with the same observable behavior as the legacy
`Py_BuildValue("s", ...)` path, frees the C allocation exactly once even when
Python conversion fails, and returns the Python-owned `str`. Phase 5B supports
exactly one Python-visible string result per function; mixed or multiple
string result aggregation remains blocked until cleanup of every unconverted
native allocation is explicitly planned. A function that combines a public
fixed string result with native status-error projection is blocked for the
same reason: the status failure path must not bypass the string allocation's
planned release.

Validation requires a fixed positive length, `ObjectKind.STRING`, Python-owned
copy-return ownership, no Python barrier action, the source-appropriate
codegen/native action, `BridgeDataAction.COPY_REPRESENTATION` with the standard
fixed-string copy reason, and matching result/native-slot lengths for hidden
outputs. Direct results must not carry a native-call slot; hidden results must
share their function slot by identity. The C and Fortran backends dispatch
`DatatypeFamily.STRING` to `_lower_result_fixed_string()` methods instead of
the primitive scalar registry.

Replay direct results from the existing `fstrings_f90` native object with a
reduced contract entry exporting `char_result_default`,
`char_result_c_char`, `string_result_fixed`, `string_result_padded`, and
`string_result_c_char`. Replay the hidden output from the existing
`fcharacter_edges_f90.make_out` unit through another reduced entry. Run the
same trailing-blank and returned-value assertions through legacy and direct
routes. The original mixed nodes remain `legacy` on deferred results, writable
strings, optionality, or arrays.

- [x] Complete fixed-length direct and hidden string result policy, result-plan
  length facts, allocation/failure cleanup, binding conversion, bridge copy,
  validation, legacy/direct parity, support widening, and ledger updates.

### Phase 5C — Immutable String Output And Inout Replacement

Included: fixed and assumed-length Python `str` output/inout dummies, including
the pass-by-address mutable native call. Python strings remain immutable: the
binding creates mutable call-local storage; the bridge passes that storage to
the native dummy; a declared `Returns["name", String...]` consumer returns a
replacement string; identity form discards native mutation and returns `None`.
Fixed buffers retain their complete post-call contents and trailing blanks;
assumed-length buffers use the encoded input length. Optional omitted,
explicit-`None`, and concrete-value states are handled here after required
replacement works.

The first Phase 5C slice is required fixed-length `String[n]` only. A projected
replacement consumes completed `ObjectKind.STRING`, Python-owned
`COPY_RETURN`, `PYTHON_REFCOUNT`, stack contract storage,
`PythonBarrierAction.STRING_VALUE`,
`NativeBarrierAction.PASS_CALL_LOCAL_ADDRESS`,
`CodegenAction.COPY_IN_OUT`, native mutation, result projection, and
`BridgeDataAction.COPY_REPRESENTATION` with the fixed-string replacement copy
reason. The ordinary argument plan records those facts plus the fixed positive
character length, and its binding and bridge views both carry the completed
codegen action. The same mutable native-call slot is referenced throughout;
there is no second output slot.

The binding validates the input exactly as Phase 5A does, allocates one
`n + 1` byte call-local buffer through `x2py_malloc`, copies all `n` encoded
bytes, and appends NUL. Allocation failure raises `MemoryError` before native
execution. The bridge receives the mutable buffer and length, materializes
backend-local `character(kind=c_char, len=n)` storage, passes that storage to
the native dummy, then copies the complete post-call value back into the
binding buffer and restores the NUL terminator. After the call, binding
`_lower_writeback_string()` converts the replacement with the same
`Py_BuildValue("s", ...)` behavior as the legacy route and frees the call-local
buffer exactly once whether conversion succeeds or fails.

The existing ordered lifecycle records remain authoritative:

```text
COPY_IN (binding allocation and input copy)
  -> NATIVE_MUTATION (bridge-local character call and copyback)
  -> COPY_OUT (binding Python replacement conversion)
  -> CLEANUP (binding call-local buffer release)
```

Validation requires the completed ownership/action facts, fixed result
position, one shared payload/length handoff, matching argument and native-slot
lengths/actions/copy reasons, exactly one complete lifecycle phase set, bridge
copyback ownership only for `COPY_IN_OUT`, and binding cleanup after conversion.
A replacement combined with native status-error projection stays blocked until
the status failure path also releases the mutable buffer. Multiple projected
results remain blocked by the existing single-writeback lane.

A fixed identity contract uses the already-completed `CALL_LOCAL_INPUT` action,
the same call-local bridge character representation, no lifecycle result, and
returns `None`. Native writes affect only that temporary and are deliberately
discarded. Its binding buffer remains the borrowed read-only UTF-8 input because
the bridge never copies mutation back across the boundary. Assumed-length,
optional, mutable `String[n][()]`, and raw-address forms remain excluded from
this first slice.

Replay both forms from the existing `fcharacter_edges_f90.fixed_inout` native
unit through a reduced edited contract that exports one projected replacement
and one identity spelling bound to the same native symbol. Run the same exact
length, trailing-blank, input-immutability, returned-value, and allocation
failure assertions through legacy and direct routes before widening the
whole-unit support predicate.

The second Phase 5C slice keeps the same completed ownership, barrier,
representation-copy, and four-phase lifecycle records while removing the
compile-time-length restriction. For required assumed-length `String`, the
binding-recorded UTF-8 byte length is the native character length and the
replacement allocation size. A zero-byte input is valid: replacement owns a
one-byte NUL-only buffer, the bridge materializes a zero-length character
value, and binding returns the empty Python string after releasing the buffer.
Fixed strings still require the exact declared encoded length.

Optional string values use the completed `OptionalMode.NULLABLE_VALUE`; they
do not invent a descriptor or reinterpret optionality as semantic nullability.
The binding ABI always carries the string payload pointer and runtime byte
length. Omitted and explicit `None` both send a null pointer with length zero,
so the bridge leaves the native optional dummy absent and a projected
replacement returns `None`. A concrete value is validated before native
execution, including embedded-NUL rejection and any fixed-length constraint.
Projected replacement allocates and owns the mutable `length + 1` buffer only
for that concrete value; identity form borrows the read-only payload and
discards native mutation exactly as the required identity path does.

The bridge tests pointer association to choose the existing optional native
call branch. Only the present branch associates the payload, creates
`character(kind=c_char, len=runtime_length)` call-local storage, and invokes
the native optional dummy. Copyback is likewise guarded by pointer association,
so an absent optional never touches unassociated storage. Concrete projected
replacement restores the NUL terminator after copying all runtime-length
bytes. Binding then returns the concrete replacement and frees its allocation
exactly once, or returns `None` without calling `free` for the absent states.
Status-error combination and multiple projected replacements remain blocked
by the same explicit cleanup exclusions as the fixed required slice.

Replay `assumed_inout` and `optional_inout` from the existing
`fcharacter_edges_f90` contract through a reduced entry module. Compare legacy
and direct routes for empty and non-empty assumed-length values, omitted,
explicit-`None`, and concrete optional states, input immutability, embedded-NUL
rejection before native execution, and allocator failure only for concrete
projected replacements.

- [x] Complete fixed required replacement and discarded-identity policy,
  writeback lifecycle, named lowering, cleanup, validation, parity, support
  widening, and ledger updates.
- [x] Add assumed-length replacement and optional presence only after the fixed
  required path is proven; preserve legacy empty-string and omitted/`None`
  behavior and reject embedded NUL before native execution.

### Phase 5D — Mutable Storage And Raw Fixed-Length Addresses

Included: `String[n][()]` caller-owned rank-zero NumPy bytes storage and
`Addr(String[n])` caller-supplied integer addresses. The storage path validates
rank zero, dtype `S<n>`, native byte order/alignment where applicable, and
writability before aliasing the caller buffer. The raw-address path does not
own or validate the pointee. Both use the declared fixed length; mutable
deferred-length scalar storage remains blocked.

Both forms complete policy before planning and share no Phase 5C replacement
lifecycle. `String[n][()]` records `ObjectKind.STRING`, caller ownership,
`IN_PLACE`, caller destruction, alias contract/boundary storage,
`PythonBarrierAction.STRING_STORAGE`,
`NativeBarrierAction.PASS_STORAGE_ADDRESS`, `CodegenAction.IN_PLACE_ARGUMENT`,
native mutation, no result projection, and a fixed positive character length.
`Addr(String[n])` records the same caller ownership, in-place transfer, caller
destruction, mutation, and no result projection, but the contract value itself
uses stack storage while `PythonBarrierAction.RAW_ADDRESS` and
`NativeBarrierAction.PASS_RAW_ADDRESS` preserve the unsafe caller-supplied
address. The raw pointee is never adopted, released, sized, or validated by
x2py. This corrects the pre-5D raw-string decision that incorrectly retained
immutable-string call-local ownership despite the completed raw-address
barriers.

The ordinary argument plan carries the fixed length and uses
`ArgumentHandoffMode.OPAQUE_ADDRESS` for both forms. There is one pointer ABI
field and no runtime length field: the fixed character length comes only from
the completed plan. The binding storage handler accepts exactly a rank-zero
NumPy `NPY_STRING` array whose itemsize is `n`, requires alignment and
writability, and forwards `PyArray_DATA` without allocating or copying.
The raw handler accepts an integer and uses the existing `PyLong_AsVoidPtr`
path; it deliberately does not inspect the pointee, its allocation extent, or
its lifetime.

The native character scalar is not directly C interoperable, so both forms
record `BridgeDataAction.COPY_REPRESENTATION` with a boundary-specific reason.
The bridge associates the incoming address with exactly `n`
`character(kind=c_char)` bytes, copies them into backend-local
`character(kind=c_char, len=n)` storage, invokes the native dummy, and copies
all `n` post-call bytes back. It does not append NUL, allocate, free, infer
ownership, or create a Python result. These helper locals are emitted-code
details selected by the completed storage/raw policy.

Optional storage/address arguments and projected returns remain blocked in
this phase. `String[()]` and `Addr(String)` are rejected by the semantic `.pyi`
contract because the bridge has no fixed extent; arrays and callback storage
remain owned by their later lanes. Validation rejects edited plans with a
missing/nonpositive length, the wrong owner/transfer/destruction/storage mode,
an inconsistent barrier or handoff, a runtime length role, an unjustified copy
reason, missing mutation, or result projection before either backend lowers.

Replay `fixed_inout_storage` and `fixed_inout_raw` from the existing
`fnative_call_examples_f90` edited contract through a reduced entry bound to
the same `fixed_inout` native routine. Compare legacy and direct routes for
complete eight-byte mutation, rank/dtype/itemsize/writability failures, raw
integer type rejection, and lack of Python return. Keep the existing mixed
native-order test on the legacy route because its array and derived-type
neighbors belong to later phases; add the reduced replay as a separate
wrapper-plan ledger node.

- [x] Complete mutable string-storage and raw-address policy, address handoff,
  bridge association/copyback mechanics, validation, legacy/direct parity,
  support widening, and ledger updates.

### Phase 5 Completion

Descriptor-backed scalar character values are deliberately outside this
phase. A contract such as `String | None` with
`result=Allocatable(Return(...))` carries allocation state, runtime element
length, descriptor ownership, and native release responsibility. It must enter
the direct route only through Phase 7's shared allocatable/pointer descriptor
plan; it remains a rank-zero Python `str | None` result rather than a native
array handle. Phase 5 must not add a character-only descriptor ABI or cleanup
path.

- [x] Expand the phase under the mandatory expansion gate from the live
  policies, legacy binding/bridge implementation, public string contract, and
  focused wrapper tests.
- [x] Validate fixed/runtime length sources, payload/length role agreement,
  result ownership, writeback consumers, and cleanup responsibility before
  either backend emits source.
- [x] Keep string behavior in directly named string lowering methods while
  reusing the ordinary scalar planning records and lifecycle flow.
- [x] Finish Phase 5 only when all non-descriptor scalar string sub-lanes are
  proven and every affected matrix row is either `wrapper-plan` or blocked by
  a later array, descriptor, field, or callback lane recorded in the ledger.

## Phase 6 — Ordinary Arrays

Scope: NumPy data-buffer arrays that do not require native descriptor handles.

The ordinary-array lane borrows or copies NumPy data buffers; it never creates
or consumes a persistent native descriptor handle. `Allocatable[T[...]]`,
`Pointer[T[...]]`, rank-zero allocatable/pointer scalars, and a native handle
used as the actual value for an ordinary array dummy all remain in Phase 7.
Caller-supplied `Addr(T[...])` storage is the distinct Phase 6G follow-up and
must complete before Phase 7.
Derived-type arrays remain in Phase 8, fields in Phases 8 and 9, and callback
arrays in Phase 10. The full BLAS/LAPACK generation unit remains deferred until
final cutover even when individual ordinary-array shapes become supported.

Whole-generation-unit rollout preserves that Phase 7 boundary. Output-only
ordinary array results and hidden outputs may select the production plan route
now. A generation unit with an ordinary array actual remains on the legacy
route, even after its NumPy-buffer path has direct-route parity, because route
selection cannot know whether a caller will pass a NumPy array or a supported
native descriptor handle. Those reduced array-actual rows remain `dual-route`
with the native-handle caller contract recorded as their sole Phase 7 blocker;
the direct route is forced only by the internal parity harness.

The public behavior is defined by the NumPy array contract in
`docs/user/guide/fortran-wrapper.md`, the array spelling and metadata rules in
`docs/user/reference/semantic-pyi-format.md`, and the existing array wrapper
tests. The legacy binding validates exact dtype, rank, every expressible
extent, native byte order, alignment, layout/stride requirements, and
writeability for mutable storage before the native call. It does not cast,
byte-swap, repair alignment, de-alias overlapping storage, or silently copy a
rejected layout. Read-only source `intent(in)` storage may remain read-only;
edited `.pyi` array storage is writable unless a completed policy says
otherwise. Zero-sized dimensions are valid when the rest of the contract is
valid.

Every ordinary array remains in the existing
`ArgumentPolicy -> ArgumentTransferPlan -> NativeCallSlotPlan` or
`ResultPolicy -> ResultPlan` flow. An argument embeds one editable array
handoff spec containing element family, concrete or runtime rank, declared
shape expressions, axis modes, order, contiguity, itemsize when relevant,
writeability, and the exact ABI roles for data, extents, upper bounds, strides,
runtime rank, or itemsize. Policy completion selects
`PythonBarrierAction.ARRAY_STORAGE`,
`NativeBarrierAction.PASS_ARRAY_BUFFER`, and either
`BridgeDataAction.ASSOCIATE_VIEW` for caller storage or an explicit copy action
and reason. Planning must not reconstruct any of those choices from rank,
shape spelling, or datatype. The binding and bridge dispatch only to directly
named array implementation methods selected by those completed facts.

The binding checks the NumPy object before extracting `PyArray_DATA`, shape,
and element strides. The bridge receives only the fields named by the handoff
spec, associates the pointer with the completed element type and extents, and
constructs a stride slice only when the plan explicitly allows it. C-oriented
flat storage reverses bridge association extents only when the completed order
requires it. Backend-local pointer views and slice expressions are emitted-code
details; dtype, rank, extent, order, stride acceptance, mutation, projection,
copy, and ownership are semantic policy.

The phase is dependency-ordered as follows.

### Phase 6A — Required Rank-One Contiguous Buffers

Included: required concrete-rank-one ordinary arrays with dense contiguous
axes (`T[:]`) for the existing bool, integer, real, and complex primitive
families; caller-owned borrowed/in-place storage; scalar or void neighbors and
results already supported by earlier phases; native position reordering; and
zero-length buffers. The binding requires an exact NumPy dtype, rank one,
native byte order, alignment, contiguity, and writeability only when completed
ownership says native code mutates the storage. It forwards the data address
and runtime extent. The bridge creates one typed rank-one pointer view with
`c_f_pointer` and passes that view in the completed native-call position.

This slice records `ArgumentHandoffMode.ARRAY_BUFFER` and
`BridgeDataAction.ASSOCIATE_VIEW`; it performs no allocation, element copy,
writeback action, release, or Python result projection. Explicit/fixed extent
expressions, `Flat`, multidimensional order, strided axes, optionality,
projected output identity, array results, character arrays, assumed rank, and
native-handle actuals remain in later sub-lanes. Replay one existing
`fmath_arrays_f90` contiguous routine through a reduced semantic `.pyi` entry
and compare legacy/direct behavior for mutation, dtype, rank, alignment,
byte-order, contiguity, writeability, zero length, and native argument order.

- [x] Complete required rank-one contiguous array policy, editable handoff
  spec, validation, named C/Fortran lowering, reduced legacy/direct parity,
  support widening, and ledger evidence.

### Phase 6B — Declared Extents, Flat Storage, And Dense Rank

Included: fixed and visible-symbol extent expressions, lower-bound-derived
extents, assumed-size `Flat`, ranks two through fifteen, `ORDER_F` and
`ORDER_C`, dense contiguous layout, and zero-sized axes. Shape expressions are
resolved against existing scalar handoff roles before backend emission; the
bridge association order follows the completed layout. Any expression that
cannot be represented by available roles remains blocked rather than being
recomputed in a backend.

Order is an exact-storage selector, not an implicit conversion selector.
`ORDER_F` preserves logical axes over Fortran-contiguous storage. `ORDER_C`
passes the original C-contiguous address and reverses bridge extents, so native
Fortran observes the transposed storage view. Preserving the same logical axes
while accepting the opposite layout uses explicit `COPY_F` metadata, never an
inference from order. The owning `ArgumentTransferPlan` records C source order,
F native order, copy-in, conditional copy-out, original-object projection, and
temporary cleanup. The binding performs both copy directions and owns the
NumPy temporary. The bridge receives the temporary through the unchanged
ORDER_F association path and performs neither half of this representation
conversion.

The initial `COPY_F` lane includes required, concrete-rank, dense numeric
ndarray arguments. It excludes `Flat`, assumed-rank, strided, optional and
character arrays, native descriptor arguments, and handle actuals until each
has separate policy and parity evidence.

`Flat` is one axis marker and never collapses a multidimensional plan:
`T[:, Flat]` remains rank two in Fortran order, while
`Annotated[T[Flat, :], ORDER_C]` is its C-order orientation. The bridge reverses
only the C-order association extents. For an external assumed-size interface,
an explicit prefix such as `T[3, Flat]` may lower to `a(3, *)`; a runtime-only
prefix uses the standards-valid sequence-associated `a(*)` declaration while
the bridge retains every runtime extent and the completed logical rank.

- [x] Complete declared-shape evaluation, flat-storage orientation,
  multidimensional dense handoff, validation, parity, and ledger evidence.
- [x] Complete explicit C-to-Fortran representation copies through `COPY_F`,
  including native-input and inout calls through the same binding-owned copy
  lifecycle, projected original identity, temporary cleanup, direct bridge
  reuse, validation, and compiled parity. Native `intent` remains owned by the
  called procedure and is not duplicated in the semantic `.pyi` or bridge
  temporary.

### Phase 6C — Positive-Strided Ordinary Views

Included: `::` axes and bounded stride-aware axes, runtime upper bounds and
element strides, Fortran-oriented positive-stride slicing, contiguous views as
a valid special case, and degenerate zero-size strides. Negative, zero on an
addressable axis, incompatible C-oriented, broadcast, and otherwise invalid
layouts fail before the native call. No copy-to-contiguous fallback is inferred.

- [x] Complete stride roles, upper bounds, positive-stride bridge slices,
  layout validation, parity, and ledger evidence.

### Phase 6D — Output Storage And Projected Identity

Included: ordinary `intent(out)`/`intent(inout)` caller buffers and
`Returns["name", T[...]]` projections. Native code mutates the same validated
NumPy storage; the binding returns the original Python array object with one
owned reference rather than constructing a second array or copying elements.
Read-only output storage fails before the call. Multiple projections compose
with the existing ordered result aggregation only after every projected array
identity and failure-path reference is planned.

- [x] Complete in-place output ownership, projected identity/reference
  lifecycle, multiple-result aggregation, parity, and ledger evidence.

### Phase 6E — Ordinary Array Results And Hidden Outputs

Included: non-allocatable direct array results and hidden output arrays whose
shape and element ownership are fully expressible without persistent native
descriptors. The plan records the producer, every runtime extent, allocation
owner, copy or transfer action, Python NumPy construction, and release on
success and every failure path. Nullable allocatable/pointer results remain in
Phase 7.

- [x] Complete ordinary result/hidden-output allocation, shape projection,
  copy ownership, cleanup, parity, and ledger evidence.

### Phase 6F — Optional, Assumed-Rank, And Character Buffers

Included: ordinary optional NumPy arrays, numeric assumed-rank dispatch from
one through fifteen, and fixed-width NumPy bytes character arrays with planned
itemsize. Omitted ordinary optional arrays remain distinct from present
storage. Assumed-rank plans carry a runtime-rank role and validate the supported
range before bridge dispatch. Character arrays use exact `NPY_STRING` itemsize
and remain raw fixed-width bytes; deferred descriptor-backed character values
remain in Phase 7. Fixed-shape character array direct results and hidden
outputs reuse the Phase 6E copy-result path with their itemsize included in
NumPy dtype construction and bridge byte-count calculation.

- [x] Complete optional presence, assumed-rank dispatch, character itemsize,
  validation, parity, and ledger evidence.

### Phase 6A-F Ordinary-Buffer Completion

- [x] Expand the phase under the mandatory expansion gate from live semantic
  array contracts, legacy binding/bridge lowering, public docs, and focused
  wrapper tests.
- [x] Define array handoff specs for every supported data, rank, shape, stride,
  order, itemsize, writeability, result, and lifecycle role.
- [x] Validate every completed array policy and handoff role before either
  backend emits source.
- [x] Finish Phases 6A-F only when every ordinary-array buffer matrix row is
  migrated or remains blocked solely by an explicitly later descriptor,
  derived, field, callback, or deferred-real-library lane.

### Phase 6G — Raw Array Addresses — Complete

Implementation status: complete. Required raw array addresses now use the
shared completed policy, `ArgumentTransferPlan`, native slot, centralized
validation, and named binding/bridge lowering paths. The dependency-closed
numeric and fixed-character runtime rows have passed compiled legacy/direct
parity and moved to `wrapper-plan`.

Scope: required Python-visible type-level raw-address array arguments such as
`Addr(Float64[n])`. The caller supplies one Python integer address, x2py
forwards it as one opaque C address, and the bridge associates a typed native
array view using rank, shape, element type, and orientation facts completed
before `ir2ast.py`. There is no NumPy object, runtime handle, persistent native
descriptor, data copy, ownership transfer, or automatic release.

This lane follows Phase 6 because its semantic object kind is
`ObjectKind.NUMPY_ARRAY` and its pointee layout reuses the array shape record.
It remains a distinct transport from an ordinary array buffer. The fixed
dispatch algorithm is:

1. match `ObjectKind.NUMPY_ARRAY`;
2. match the completed Python barrier action;
3. lower `ARRAY_STORAGE` through the Phase 6A-F buffer path or `RAW_ADDRESS`
   through Phase 6G;
4. require the matching native action, handoff mode, bridge data action, and
   array-shape facts; and
5. fail validation rather than substituting the other transport.

The same algorithm already separates scalar and string value, storage, and
raw-address forms. Phase 6G must extend that system; it must not add a parallel
raw-pointer planner, a datatype-based backend branch, or a special function or
module plan.

#### Public Contract And Explicit Non-Scope

The maintained public contract is already documented in
`docs/user/reference/semantic-pyi-format.md` and
`docs/user/guide/data-types.md`. Preserve it exactly:

- `Addr(T[d1, ..., dr])` is depth one and has positive rank;
- the pointee dtype is primitive;
- every extent expression is resolved from literals and visible scalar
  arguments or visible rank-zero scalar storage;
- the integer carries no dtype, rank, shape, order, alignment, bounds,
  ownership, or lifetime metadata;
- x2py cannot prove that the supplied address actually points to compatible,
  sufficiently large, live storage; and
- edited semantic `.pyi` raw-address storage is mutable caller storage unless
  a completed policy explicitly says otherwise.

The initial compiled oracle is `Addr(Float64[n])`. Before declaring the lane
complete, audit every public primitive family already accepted by semantic
policy, including bool, integer, real, complex, and fixed-width character
array pointees. Add compiled coverage for a family only when an existing native
routine can prove it without broadening the public contract. A fixed scalar
`Addr(String[n])` remains the completed Phase 5D string path; a rank-positive
`Addr(String[k][n, ...])` is an array path and must carry both the fixed element
length and the resolved array shape.

Explicitly excluded from this lane are:

- scalar `Addr(T)`, already completed in Phase 2E;
- fixed scalar `Addr(String[n])`, already completed in Phase 5D;
- NumPy `T[...]` storage, already completed in Phases 6A-F;
- unresolved or assumed shapes such as `Addr(Float64[:])`, assumed rank,
  assumed size, and stride-marker shapes;
- optional, nullable, projected, direct-result, and hidden-output raw addresses
  unless a separate public-contract audit first proves their intended Python
  ownership and absence/result behavior;
- wrapped/derived pointees, pointer graphs deeper than one, and callbacks;
- `Allocatable[T[...]]`, `Pointer[T[...]]`, runtime native handles, and C
  descriptors, which belong to Phase 7; and
- any implicit conversion from an ndarray or runtime handle to its address.

#### One Action Vocabulary, Three Array Transports

| Contract | Object kind | Python action | Native action | Handoff mode | Bridge data action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NumPy `T[...]` | `NUMPY_ARRAY` | `ARRAY_STORAGE` | `PASS_ARRAY_BUFFER` | `ARRAY_BUFFER` | `ASSOCIATE_VIEW` |
| Raw `Addr(T[...])` | `NUMPY_ARRAY` | `RAW_ADDRESS` | `PASS_RAW_ADDRESS` | `OPAQUE_ADDRESS` | `ASSOCIATE_VIEW` |
| Native descriptor contract | completed handle kind | completed handle action | `PASS_NATIVE_DESCRIPTOR` | Phase 7 descriptor mode | completed Phase 7 action |

`ASSOCIATE_VIEW` means the bridge creates a typed, non-owning view; it does not
mean that the Python binding extracted a NumPy buffer. The Python and native
barrier actions remain the authoritative distinction. Do not introduce names
such as `PASS_RAW_ARRAY`, `COPY_RAW_ARRAY`, or datatype-specific address
actions.

The completed ownership/action tuple for the required mutable public form is:

- `OwnershipOwner.CALLER`;
- `TransferMode.IN_PLACE`;
- `DestructionPolicy.CALLER`;
- `StorageMode.STACK` for the call-local pointer carrier, not for the pointee;
- `CodegenAction.IN_PLACE_ARGUMENT`;
- `PythonBarrierAction.RAW_ADDRESS`;
- `NativeBarrierAction.PASS_RAW_ADDRESS`;
- `ArgumentHandoffMode.OPAQUE_ADDRESS`; and
- `BridgeDataAction.ASSOCIATE_VIEW` with no copy reason.

If a retained source-derived contract can be read-only, policy may instead
complete `CALL_LOCAL` / `CALL_LOCAL_INPUT` / `NONE` destruction. Both
backends must consume that completed tuple; neither may infer mutability from
the pointee type or raw-address spelling. A raw array never has copy-in,
copy-out, projected-identity, allocation, destruction, release, or lifecycle
actions in this lane.

#### Required Policy And Plan Shape

Keep the feature under the existing `ArgumentTransferPlan`:

```text
ArgumentTransferPlan
  object_kind = NUMPY_ARRAY
  binding.python_action = RAW_ADDRESS
  bridge.native_action = PASS_RAW_ADDRESS
  bridge.handoff_mode = OPAQUE_ADDRESS
  bridge.data_action = ASSOCIATE_VIEW
  array = ArrayHandoffPlan
  native_call_slot = the same referenced NativeCallSlotPlan
```

Do not add `RawArrayPlan`, a second native slot, or a raw-address lifecycle
owner. Generalize the existing completed `ArrayHandoffPolicy` and
`ArrayHandoffPlan` only enough to carry raw pointee layout:

- concrete rank and one shape expression per axis;
- one `data_role` equal to the binding/bridge/native-slot address role;
- `extent_reference_roles` naming the existing visible scalar handoff roles
  used by each shape expression;
- the completed orientation used for native pointer association;
- fixed character element length/itemsize when the pointee family is string;
  and
- no binding-extracted runtime rank, extent, upper-bound, stride, or itemsize
  ABI roles.

For a raw address, the shape record describes the pointee view; it does not
describe fields packed by the binding. A visible `n` used by
`Addr(Float64[n])` already has its own `ArgumentTransferPlan` and native-call
slot. Reference that role rather than passing a duplicate array extent. A
literal extent requires no extra ABI field. The bridge resolves the shape
expression from those planned native role names.

Post-IR policy completion must explicitly select multidimensional orientation
before planning. Preserve the current legacy interpretation, including its
default orientation, only after capturing a rank-two artifact/runtime oracle.
Do not leave `ir2ast.py`, a codegen-model `order` default, or the bridge's local
shape reversal to make that decision.

#### Completed Direct-Plan Seams

The implementation split completed array policy by Python barrier action,
selected `OPAQUE_ADDRESS` and `ASSOCIATE_VIEW` before lowering, projected raw
pointee layout into the shared array record, omitted packed NumPy-buffer roles,
and added named raw-address checks and association methods to both backends.
Ordinary-array buffer checks remain unchanged and fail closed; neither backend
substitutes one transport for another.

#### Dependency-Ordered Implementation Slices

##### Phase 6G1 — Complete Raw Array Policy

- [x] Make the `NUMPY_ARRAY` boundary validator dispatch on
  `PythonBarrierAction` and add a named raw-address branch with the exact
  ownership/action tuple above.
- [x] Complete raw pointee rank, shape expressions and their visible-scalar
  dependencies, primitive family, fixed character element length, and
  orientation before `ir2ast.py`.
- [x] Complete `OPAQUE_ADDRESS` and `ASSOCIATE_VIEW` from the action pair; do
  not infer either in a backend.
- [x] Keep unresolved dimensions, unsupported pointee families, optionality,
  projection, nullability, and deeper pointer graphs blocked with owner-path
  diagnostics.
- [x] Freeze current behavior for zero/negative extent expressions, zero or
  negative integer addresses, and integer overflow against the public docs and
  legacy conversion before changing any rule. If a rule changes, change it in
  policy and public docs, not in one backend.

Audit result: resolved zero and negative extent expressions remain accepted
without a positivity check; integer zero becomes a null pointer without a
conversion error; negative integers follow `PyLong_AsVoidPtr`; and pointer-size
overflow raises `OverflowError`. Public documentation now states that these are
unsafe caller responsibilities, and tests prove the conversion guard and
generated shape without dereferencing an invalid address.

##### Phase 6G2 — Project And Validate The Shared Plan

- [x] Populate the existing `ArgumentTransferPlan.array` and its shared
  `NativeCallSlotPlan.array` with one identical raw pointee layout record.
- [x] Reuse the scalar/string address handoff role and
  `ArgumentHandoffMode.OPAQUE_ADDRESS`; add no raw-array ABI action.
- [x] Resolve every shape symbol to an existing visible scalar role and reject
  unavailable, cyclic, hidden, non-scalar, or result-only dependencies before
  lowering.
- [x] Split central array diagnostics by the completed Python action so buffer
  validation still requires packed extent/layout roles while raw validation
  forbids them.
- [x] Add editable-plan tests that independently corrupt object kind, Python
  action, native action, handoff mode, bridge data action, rank, shape,
  reference roles, element family, character length, orientation, and native
  slot identity.

##### Phase 6G3 — Reuse Binding Raw-Address Extraction

- [x] Reuse `_lower_argument_required_raw_address()` for the Python integer
  check and `PyLong_AsVoidPtr` conversion. Scalar, string, and array raw
  addresses should share this extraction code.
- [x] Emit one `void *` handoff value and no `PyArray_*`, dtype, rank, shape,
  layout, writeability, or itemsize checks.
- [x] Keep object-kind-specific logic out of the conversion method; array
  shape affects only validation, the bridge view, and native call.
- [x] Preserve the existing conversion rule under which integer zero produces
  a null pointer without itself raising a Python conversion error. Prove that
  rule without dereferencing the null pointer; runtime tests must never call
  native code with an invalid test address.

##### Phase 6G4 — Add Named Raw Array Bridge Association

- [x] Add directly named raw-array declaration and association methods in the
  array method group. Dispatch to them only for
  `NUMPY_ARRAY` / `RAW_ADDRESS` / `PASS_RAW_ADDRESS` /
  `OPAQUE_ADDRESS` / `ASSOCIATE_VIEW`.
- [x] Declare one `type(c_ptr), value` bridge parameter and one backend-local
  typed pointer view. The local view is an emitted-code helper, not a new plan
  owner.
- [x] Associate the view with `c_f_pointer` using only the planned shape and
  orientation, then pass that view in the existing native-call slot position.
- [x] Preserve fixed character element length when the pointee is a character
  array. Do not pass a runtime itemsize unless a future public contract
  explicitly requires one.
- [x] Emit no copy, writeback, allocation, release, descriptor, or NumPy
  mechanics.

##### Phase 6G5 — Prove The Route Before Widening It

- [x] Retain semantic conversion coverage in
  `tests/semantics/conversion/pyi/test_calls_and_projections.py` for round-trip,
  visible extent sources, primitive pointees, and rejection of unresolved or
  wrapped forms.
- [x] Add focused completed-policy tests for every authoritative action and
  blocker, plus `array-raw-address-inputs` support classification.
- [x] Add `tests/wrapper_codegen/test_phase6g_raw_array_addresses.py` for plan
  shape, edits, validation, C nodes, Fortran nodes, native order, and the
  absence of buffer/descriptor/lifecycle nodes.
- [x] Extract `fill_vector_raw` from
  `test_editable_contract_can_use_native_order_arguments_without_native_call`
  into a reduced legacy/direct-plan parity test. Cover mutation through a valid
  `raw_vector.ctypes.data`, ndarray rejection, wrong Python types, a visible
  rank-zero scalar extent, and the established native argument order.
- [x] Prove raw-array native argument reordering in the direct-plan generated
  call test. The legacy AST route retains only a projection marker and is not
  an oracle for reordered projection-slot lowering.
- [x] Add literal and arithmetic extent-role cases. Add a rank-two runtime
  parity case before freezing default/explicit orientation. Add a fixed-width
  character-array case if the public family audit retains that contract.
- [x] Keep the broad native-order test `legacy` until its derived-type owner is
  migrated; only the reduced raw-array row may move to `wrapper-plan` here.
- [x] Run the focused policy/plan/backend tests, the relevant wrapper test,
  documentation checks, wrapper-codegen complexity checker, and required
  static-analysis suite before changing route support.

#### Phase 6G Exit Gate

- [x] Expand raw array addresses as the explicit next lane using the public
  contract, completed semantic policy, legacy binding/bridge primitives, and
  the existing compiled `Addr(Float64[n])` oracle.
- [x] Complete Phases 6G1 through 6G5 without changing the public raw-address
  contract or introducing a parallel action vocabulary.
- [x] Prove that one maintainer algorithm—object kind, Python action, native
  action, handoff mode, data action, then typed shape facts—covers ordinary and
  raw arrays without backend inference.
- [x] Move only dependency-closed raw-array test rows after generated-artifact
  comparison and compiled legacy/direct parity pass.
- [x] Begin Phase 7 only after this exit gate is complete. Phase 7 must consume
  the established distinction among array buffers, raw addresses, and native
  descriptors rather than revisiting it.

## Phase 7 — Native Array Handles And Descriptors

Implementation status: reopened for the view-only `to_numpy()` contract
correction. The previously completed direct Phase 7A-H slices remain evidence
for unaffected descriptor handoffs, but Phase 7 is not closed again until
plain and `Aliased` module-array handles both return a current live view or
`None` without an implicit copy and the final verification gate is rerun.
Every field, pointer-result, callback, and deferred-real-library exclusion
remains on its later blocker.

Scope: migrate the existing native descriptor and runtime-handle contract into
the wrapper-plan path without redefining that public contract. The maintained
`native-array-handle-checklist.md` remains the feature-level behavioral oracle;
this section owns only its migration into completed wrapper policy,
`ArgumentTransferPlan`, `ResultPlan`, `ModuleVariablePlan`, subordinate native
slots and lifecycle actions, direct C/Fortran lowering, and production route
selection.

The shared descriptor family includes:

- rank-positive `Allocatable[T[...]]` and `Pointer[T[...]]` handle arguments;
- optional-absent array handles, where omission or `None` means the native
  optional dummy is absent;
- projected writable descriptors whose mutation must remain attached to the
  same caller handle;
- wrapper-owned allocatable array results and hidden outputs;
- borrowed module allocatable and pointer handles plus their generated operation
  tables;
- native handles passed as actual values to ordinary `T[...]` dummies without
  an implicit `.to_numpy()` call;
- build requirements for standard C descriptors; and
- the remaining rank-zero allocatable/pointer result cases, including nullable
  deferred-length scalar character values, which return copied Python values
  rather than native-array handle objects.

Allocatable and Pointer remain separate public contract types but share one
plan and lowering structure. Descriptor kind selects only the operations that
genuinely differ: allocation state versus association state, allowed
shape-changing operations, target lifetime, extraction policy, and release.
Do not create independent allocatable and pointer planner hierarchies.

For every rank-positive module handle, `to_numpy()` has one public result:
`None` for an unallocated/unassociated native object and a live NumPy view of
the current allocation/target otherwise. Plain and `Aliased` allocatable
module variables use the same behavior. `Aliased` remains semantic metadata
but never selects a detached copy. Users call `.copy()` explicitly for
independent storage; an old live view may become stale after native
deallocation, reallocation, nullification, or reassociation, and a fresh
`to_numpy()` call must inspect current native state.

### Phase 7 Boundary And Explicit Non-Scope

The following four boundaries must remain distinct:

| Python contract | Planned Python input | Native transport | Owner phase |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `T[...]` with a NumPy array | validated NumPy storage | `PASS_ARRAY_BUFFER` | Phase 6 |
| `T[...]` with an allocated/associated native handle actual | validated handle array-data facet | `PASS_ARRAY_BUFFER` | Phase 7A |
| `Allocatable[T[...]]` / `Pointer[T[...]]` | matching runtime handle object | `PASS_NATIVE_DESCRIPTOR` | Phase 7B onward |
| `Addr(T[n, ...])` | caller-supplied integer address | `PASS_RAW_ADDRESS` | Phase 6G prerequisite, not Phase 7 |

`Addr(Float64[n])` is a supported public semantic `.pyi` contract when
every extent is a literal or an expression over visible scalar arguments or
rank-zero scalar storage. It accepts an integer such as `array.ctypes.data` and
forwards that address without ownership, dtype, alignment, lifetime, or bounds
validation. Parsing, policy completion, printing, and both compiled wrapper
routes support it through the completed
`RAW_ADDRESS` / `PASS_RAW_ADDRESS` selector pair. Do not misclassify this raw
pointer as a NumPy buffer, native handle, or C descriptor while maintaining
Phase 7.

Other exclusions and dependencies are:

- ordinary NumPy-only buffer extraction, shape, stride, output identity, and
  copy-result behavior already completed in Phase 6;
- caller-supplied raw array addresses, completed separately by the Phase 6G
  entry dependency;
- derived-type field attachment, class construction, parent-wrapper creation,
  and property orchestration, which require Phases 8 and 9 even though the
  shared native-handle plan must already be reusable by those later owners;
- scalar derived module-variable member access and argument compatibility,
  which belong to Phase 8. Phase 7 descriptor machinery remains limited to
  array handles; scalar derived module allocatables use the exact local
  move-out/move-back route specified in Phase 8H and do not consume Phase 7 CFI
  descriptor machinery. A failed scalar-object call handoff must not become a
  module-access blocker;
- pointer results without completed stable owner storage and target lifetime;
- callback descriptor arguments or results, which remain in Phase 10;
- compiler-private descriptor layout inspection or copying;
- any implicit `.to_numpy()` conversion when a native handle is passed to an
  ordinary array dummy; and
- the deferred BLAS/LAPACK generation unit until final cutover.

### Existing Semantic Authority And Legacy Oracle

Do not redesign the public feature while migrating it. Reuse these completed
sources of truth:

- `x2py/semantics/native_array_handles.py` defines
  `NativeArrayHandlePolicy`, `ArrayInteropPolicy`, handle facts, descriptor
  kinds, and completed build requirements.
- `x2py/semantics/policy_completion.py` completes handle kind, origin, owner,
  owner retention, descriptor ownership, getter/setter behavior, output
  projection, release, target lifetime, destruction, extraction, interop,
  nullability, storage mode, operations, and blockers before `ir2ast.py`.
- `x2py/runtime/handles.py` owns the reusable runtime protocol, including
  `_native_array_actual_argument_for_binding_positional`,
  `_native_array_descriptor_argument_for_binding_positional`, and
  `_native_array_descriptor_handoff_for_binding_positional`. Direct lowering
  must call these helpers rather than duplicate their Python validation.
- `x2py/codegen/bindings/c_to_python.py` is the legacy binding oracle. Its
  `_ARRAY_INTEROP_POLICY_DISPATCHER`, `_NATIVE_ARRAY_HANDLE_DISPATCHER`,
  descriptor-argument handlers, owned-result handlers, operation wrappers, and
  descriptor reader define the currently passing C behavior.
- `x2py/codegen/bridges/fortran_to_c.py` is the legacy bridge oracle. Its
  corresponding dispatchers, descriptor-argument handlers, module/field
  operation generators, and owned-allocatable result helpers define the
  currently passing Fortran behavior.
- `x2py/pipeline/build.py` already derives native-array build requirements from
  completed semantic policy and records them in manifests. The wrapper plan
  must carry and emit the matching artifact requirements without rediscovering
  them from generated source text.

The legacy generators are behavioral oracles, not dependencies of
`x2py/wrapper_codegen`. Reuse the runtime helpers and completed semantic
records directly. Rewrite the smallest equivalent node/lowering methods in the
direct generators; do not import legacy binding/bridge generator methods or
legacy codegen-model nodes into the wrapper-plan package.

### Completed Direct-Plan Shape

Wrapper policy now carries the completed native-handle and array-actual facts.
`ArgumentTransferPlan`, `ResultPlan`, and `ModuleVariablePlan` distinguish a
NumPy data-buffer transfer, a normal array dummy receiving a handle actual, and
a descriptor-handle transfer. Central validation fails closed when any typed
handoff, operation, role, ownership fact, or required header is inconsistent;
neither backend infers policy from datatype or `descriptor_boundary`.

### Required Plan Shape

Keep all descriptor-specific state subordinate to the existing datatype-
varying owners:

```text
ArgumentTransferPlan
  array: ArrayHandoffPlan | None
  native_array_actual: NativeArrayActualPlan | None
  native_array_handle: NativeArrayHandlePlan | None
    handoff: NativeDescriptorHandoffPlan
  native_call_slot: NativeCallSlotPlan

ResultPlan
  native_array_handle: NativeArrayHandlePlan | None
  native_call_slot: NativeCallSlotPlan | None

ModuleVariablePlan
  native_array_handle: NativeArrayHandlePlan | None

FunctionPlan
  native_call_slots: shared ordered references
  lifecycle actions: ordered handle materialization/release references
```

`NativeCallSlotPlan` and `LifecycleActionPlan` are not competing top-level
semantic owners. A native slot is the argument/result ABI facet shared by its
owning transfer plan, while lifecycle records are function-wide ordering
indexes back to argument/result roles. Descriptor ownership, release, and
operation policy stay under `ArgumentTransferPlan`, `ResultPlan`, or
`ModuleVariablePlan`. Backend-local CFI storage, copy buffers, and failure
cleanup remain inside the named lowerer selected by those plans.

`NativeArrayActualPlan` is used only when an ordinary `T[...]` argument permits
a runtime native handle as another source for the existing array-buffer ABI. It
records the explicitly accepted Python source kinds and the shared dtype, rank,
shape, layout, writeability, native-byte-order, alignment, and ABI-role checks.
It never carries descriptor ownership or extraction policy.

`NativeArrayHandlePlan` is one editable projection of the completed handle
policy. It must contain, using typed values rather than free-form backend
method names:

- descriptor kind and handle kind;
- origin, owner, owner-retention mode, descriptor ownership, and borrowed state;
- element datatype family, dtype, rank, declared shape, order, and character
  element length when applicable;
- getter behavior, Python setter exposure, and native setter assignment;
- output projection and same-handle identity requirements;
- release responsibility, target lifetime, destroy behavior, and storage mode;
- `.to_numpy()` extraction action and allowed generated operations;
- descriptor-interop requirement and required headers;
- nullability and optional-absent-handle behavior; and
- one `NativeDescriptorHandoffPlan` with its ABI form and symbolic roles.

`NativeDescriptorHandoffPlan` must distinguish these typed ABI forms:

- `FACT_PACKED_CALL_LOCAL`: a non-projected descriptor argument supplies
  validated standard descriptor facts; the binding passes those fields and the
  bridge establishes call-local standard C descriptor storage.
- `DIRECT_STANDARD_DESCRIPTOR`: a projected writable handle passes its
  persistent standard-descriptor pointer so allocation, deallocation,
  reassociation, and shape changes remain attached to that handle.
- `OWNED_RESULT_STORAGE`: an allocatable result is materialized into persistent
  wrapper-owned CFI storage and later destroyed by the runtime handle.

The handoff records the descriptor-pointer role when present, `base_addr`,
`elem_len`, runtime rank, per-axis lower-bound/extent/stride-multiplier roles,
an optional presence role, owner-storage role, and generated-operation roles.
The `NativeCallSlotPlan` and its owning argument or hidden result must reference
the same mutable handoff record; do not duplicate descriptor facts that a
maintainer would need to edit twice.

Convert the current string-valued completed policy selectors into typed plan
enums or validate and translate them exactly once while building wrapper
policy. Backends must not match raw strings such as `argument_descriptor`,
`projected_handle`, or `pointer_c_descriptor` to choose behavior.

### Consistent Action Vocabulary

Reuse the existing orthogonal actions:

| Case | `ObjectKind` | Python action | Native action | `CodegenAction` | Bridge data action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ordinary array with ndarray or handle actual | `NUMPY_ARRAY` | `ARRAY_STORAGE`, with explicitly planned accepted sources | `PASS_ARRAY_BUFFER` | existing Phase 6 input/in-place action | `ASSOCIATE_VIEW` |
| Read-only descriptor handle argument | `NUMPY_ARRAY` | `WRAPPER_INSTANCE` | `PASS_NATIVE_DESCRIPTOR` | `CALL_LOCAL_INPUT` | `ASSOCIATE_VIEW` |
| Writable projected descriptor handle | `NUMPY_ARRAY` | `WRAPPER_INSTANCE` | `PASS_NATIVE_DESCRIPTOR` | `IN_PLACE_ARGUMENT` | `DIRECT_TRANSFER` |
| Owned allocatable handle result | `NUMPY_ARRAY` | `NONE` | `NONE` or hidden `PASS_NATIVE_DESCRIPTOR` | `WRAPPER_INSTANCE` | `COPY_REPRESENTATION` with an ownership-transfer reason |
| Borrowed module handle getter | `NUMPY_ARRAY` | module getter action `NATIVE_ARRAY_HANDLE` | operation-specific | `BORROWED_VIEW` | completed per operation |

Using `WRAPPER_INSTANCE` for the Python handle is consistent with the existing
action axis: the binding validates and consumes a generated runtime wrapper
object, while `ObjectKind.NUMPY_ARRAY` still identifies its array semantic
family. Add a new Python action only if a proven backend operation cannot be
expressed by this existing pair. Add `ArgumentHandoffMode.NATIVE_DESCRIPTOR`
because descriptor tuples are a genuinely different binding-to-bridge ABI from
`ARRAY_BUFFER`; do not overload the Phase 6 mode.

Keep rank-zero descriptor values on the scalar or string object-kind route.
Their result action creates a Python scalar/string or `None`, not
`WRAPPER_INSTANCE`, and they must not carry `NativeArrayHandlePlan`.

### Cross-Backend Validation Invariants

Before either backend emits source, `_validate_plan()` must reject every one of
these inconsistencies:

- a descriptor plan whose completed `ObjectKind` is not `NUMPY_ARRAY`;
- `PASS_ARRAY_BUFFER` carrying descriptor ownership or CFI roles;
- `PASS_NATIVE_DESCRIPTOR` carrying ordinary data-buffer handoff roles without
  a descriptor handoff;
- a disagreement among handle policy, interop ABI, descriptor kind, handle
  kind, argument/result plan, and native-call slot;
- a required handle accepting `None`;
- an optional absent handle without a presence role, or a required handle with
  one;
- collapsing optional absence into present-unallocated/present-unassociated
  state: an absent handle has null fields and a null presence token, whereas a
  present handle may have null `base_addr` but must have a non-null presence
  token;
- fact-packed handoff for a projected writable descriptor, or direct persistent
  descriptor handoff for a policy that does not permit descriptor mutation;
- direct descriptor handoff without a typed
  `_NativeArrayDescriptorHandoff`-compatible runtime operation;
- descriptor dtype, rank, shape, element length, or per-axis field counts that
  disagree with the declared handle data facet;
- pointer reassociation, allocation, deallocation, or resize without completed
  `PointerPolicy` permission;
- a pointer result without stable owner storage and target lifetime;
- an owned result without wrapper ownership, heap/alias boundary storage,
  destroy behavior, owner retention, or a failure-path release action;
- a borrowed module/field handle that claims to destroy native owner storage;
- descriptor-view extraction without its completed C-descriptor build
  requirement;
- a C-descriptor header requirement on a generation unit whose completed plans
  do not need that interop; and
- any semantic helper temporary represented by a fabricated
  `OwnershipDecision`. Call-local CFI variables, decoded-dimension locals,
  pointer views, status locals, and operation tables are backend-local emitted
  storage inside the already selected method.

### Phase 7A — Ordinary Array Dummies Accepting Native Handle Actuals

Included: concrete-rank numeric `T[...]` arguments already supported by Phase 6
when the runtime value is either a valid ndarray, an allocated allocatable
handle, or an associated pointer handle. The handle path validates the same
dtype, rank, shape, layout, writeability, byte-order, and alignment contract,
then calls the handle's internal `array_actual` operation and packs the existing
Phase 6 pointer/extent/stride ABI. It never calls `.to_numpy()` and never passes
the allocatable/pointer descriptor to the ordinary native dummy.

Initially excluded: optional, assumed-rank, character, and unsupported
noncontiguous handle actuals. Audit each against live runtime-helper behavior
before widening this sub-lane; a rejected form must remain an explicit blocker,
not silently fall back to `.to_numpy()` or a raw address.

Those exclusions remain visible as the uncompleted
`array-handle-actuals-excluded` rollout lane. Their direct Phase 6 ndarray
lowerers remain testable with a forced wrapper-plan route, but automatic
production selection stays on the legacy route until each corresponding handle
source has parity evidence.

Legacy oracle: `CPythonBindingGenerator._native_array_actual_argument_body`,
the normal-array runtime helpers in `x2py/runtime/handles.py`, and the existing
Phase 6 bridge array-buffer lowering. Reuse the runtime helpers and bridge ABI;
rewrite only the minimal direct binding call and source-kind branch.

Plan and lowering requirements:

- [x] Add `NativeArrayActualPlan` or equivalent accepted-source facts beneath
  the existing ordinary `ArgumentTransferPlan`; keep
  `PASS_ARRAY_BUFFER`, `ArgumentHandoffMode.ARRAY_BUFFER`, and
  `ArrayHandoffPlan` unchanged.
- [x] Make the C binding's named ordinary-array input method call
  `_native_array_actual_argument_for_binding_positional` with only planned
  validation flags and ABI-field selections.
- [x] Keep the Fortran bridge on the exact Phase 6 array-buffer method; it must
  not know whether Python supplied an ndarray or a handle.
- [x] Validate that handle actuals are allocated/associated, have a non-null
  data address, and satisfy the same declared contract as ndarray inputs;
  preserve allocated/associated zero-length arrays.
- [x] Add the `array-native-handle-actuals` support lane and remove the current
  production gate on ordinary array actuals only after reduced compiled parity
  proves both runtime source kinds and all rejection paths.
- [x] Reuse the normal-array calls in
  `test_module_and_derived_pointer_handles_track_native_association` and
  allocatable handle fixtures as the legacy baseline, but extract a class-free,
  dependency-closed parity contract so Phase 8 does not determine this lane's
  route.

### Phase 7B — Required Read-Only Descriptor Handle Arguments

Included: required, non-projected `Allocatable[T[...]]` and
`Pointer[T[...]]` arguments. The Python binding accepts only the matching
runtime handle class. A present unallocated allocatable or unassociated pointer
is still a present descriptor argument and may carry a null `base_addr`.

The binding uses the existing descriptor runtime helper to obtain validated
standard descriptor facts. The bridge establishes rank-specific call-local CFI
storage from `base_addr`, `elem_len`, rank, and dimension records, then passes
the native allocatable or pointer dummy. This association is an emitted-code
view, not a semantic data copy.

Legacy oracle:

- binding `_bind_allocatable_descriptor_argument`,
  `_bind_pointer_descriptor_argument`, and
  `_bind_fact_packed_native_array_descriptor_argument`;
- bridge `_bridge_allocatable_descriptor_argument`,
  `_bridge_pointer_descriptor_argument`, and
  `_bridge_native_array_descriptor_argument`; and
- runtime `_native_array_descriptor_argument_for_binding_positional`.

- [x] Carry the completed `NativeArrayHandlePolicy` and descriptor
  `ArrayInteropPolicy` into `ArgumentPolicy`, `ArgumentTransferPlan`, and its
  shared native slot.
- [x] Add `ArgumentHandoffMode.NATIVE_DESCRIPTOR` and a
  `FACT_PACKED_CALL_LOCAL` descriptor handoff with exact symbolic roles.
- [x] Add directly named C and Fortran descriptor-input methods grouped under
  the native-array-handle family; backend-local tuple items and CFI locals may
  be created only inside those selected methods.
- [x] Validate matching handle class, descriptor kind, dtype, rank, declared
  shape, and element length before the call. Reject ndarray inputs.
- [x] Add separate `allocatable-descriptor-inputs` and
  `pointer-descriptor-inputs` support lanes after reduced descriptor-argument
  parity passes.
- [x] Replay the descriptor calls in
  `test_pointer_descriptor_views_preserve_slice_shape_strides_and_parent_lifetime`
  and the allocatable descriptor fixtures through minimal class-free contracts;
  retain the mixed original nodes as legacy until all their later owners migrate.

### Phase 7C — Optional Absent Descriptor Handles

Included: `Allocatable[T[...]] | None = ...` and
`Pointer[T[...]] | None = ...` callable arguments. Omission and explicit
`None` both mean native `present(...)` is false. A present handle remains
present even when its descriptor has absent allocation/association state.

This is a two-level handle-presence contract, not the Phase 3 scalar descriptor
three-state value contract. Do not reuse the value pointer as the presence
token. The runtime helper already produces null fact fields plus null presence
for absence, and a distinct non-null token for every present handle.

- [x] Project `optional_absent`, `nullable`, presence mode, and the dedicated
  presence role from completed handle policy without inspecting the Python
  object in planning or bridge code.
- [x] Generate both required and optional fact-packed descriptor calls through
  the Phase 7B methods, adding only the planned presence ABI field and native
  branch.
- [x] Validate required-versus-optional annotation, field count, presence role,
  and the distinction between absent handle and present null `base_addr`.
- [x] Add `optional-native-array-handles` route coverage only after compiled
  tests exercise omission, explicit `None`, present allocated/associated,
  present unallocated/unassociated, wrong handle kind, and wrong dtype/rank.
- [x] Treat the lack of one isolated compiled optional array-handle fixture as
  a coverage gap: create a reduced semantic `.pyi` entry over an existing
  native optional descriptor routine instead of inventing behavior from the
  runtime-only tests.

### Phase 7D — Writable And Projected Descriptor Handles

Included: descriptor arguments whose allocation, deallocation, resize,
reassociation, or nullification must remain visible through the same Python
handle, plus a matching projected result that returns that identical handle.
Allocatable mutation follows completed ownership. Writable pointer descriptor
mutation requires explicit `PointerPolicy` permissions and target-lifetime
facts.

Fact-packed call-local descriptors are forbidden here because native mutation
would be discarded at return. The binding must request the handle's typed
persistent standard-descriptor pointer and the bridge must pass it directly.
Returning the projection increments/transfers the existing Python reference; it
does not construct a replacement handle or call `.to_numpy()`.

The direct handoff requires generated persistent standard-descriptor storage.
Wrapper-owned result handles provide it. Borrowed module handles expose current
descriptor facts for read-only calls, but they are not accepted for projected
writable mutation because a reconstructed call-local descriptor would lose the
native descriptor update.

Legacy oracle:

- binding `_bind_direct_native_array_descriptor_argument` and
  `_bind_projected_native_array_handle_result`;
- bridge descriptor argument dispatch with completed output projection; and
- runtime `_native_array_descriptor_handoff_for_binding_positional`.

- [x] Add `DIRECT_STANDARD_DESCRIPTOR` handoff and same-handle result identity
  to the owning `ArgumentTransferPlan`, shared native slot, `ResultPlan` or
  lifecycle consumer, and function-wide result order.
- [x] Reuse `CodegenAction.IN_PLACE_ARGUMENT` and `DIRECT_TRANSFER`; do not add
  a descriptor-copy action for same-handle mutation.
- [x] Plan success and failure reference handling so a projected handle is
  returned exactly once and borrowed caller storage is never destroyed.
- [x] Validate operation permissions, descriptor ownership, target lifetime,
  direct handoff type, result identity, and optional presence before emission.
- [x] Add `projected-native-array-handles` support only after
  `test_allocatable_inout_arrays_mutate_and_return_the_same_handle` has a
  reduced legacy/direct-plan parity replay covering allocation, reallocation,
  deallocation, identity, wrong input types, and native-memory checks.
- [x] Keep writable pointer reassociation blocked unless the completed policy
  proves every required permission and lifetime fact; never downgrade it to a
  read-only fact-packed call.

### Phase 7E — Owned Allocatable Results And Hidden Outputs

Included: rank-positive allocatable direct function results and hidden output
descriptors whose completed policy selects `owned_result_descriptor`. A valid
allocatable function result is allocated when returned; an unallocated
nonpointer function result is a nonconforming native procedure and the wrapper
does not compensate for it. An allocatable output dummy may validly remain
unallocated and still returns a present `AllocatableArray` handle whose state
lives inside that handle. Pointer handle results remain blocked until stable
owner storage and target lifetime are explicit.

For a numeric direct allocatable function result, the bridge assigns the native
function expression once into a procedure-local allocatable and then uses
`move_alloc` to transfer that allocation into the allocatable `intent(out)`
dummy backed by persistent wrapper-owned `CFI_CDESC_T(rank)` storage. The move
does not copy the array payload. Do not insert a collector helper, an
`allocated(...)` guard, or a second intrinsic assignment. The native function
must return an allocated, defined result; an unallocated result is a
nonconforming native procedure and remains the user's responsibility rather
than a wrapper fallback. Other procedure-local storage remains permitted only
when representation conversion genuinely requires it, such as
deferred-character byte materialization. The binding constructs the complete
generated operation table and Python handle only after owner storage is valid.
Ownership transfers to the handle exactly once; every earlier failure path
releases the persistent allocation and any genuinely required bridge-local
allocation.

Character-element handles carry runtime `elem_len` and declared element-length
policy in the same descriptor record. Because a deferred character width is
unknown until the native result exists, the bridge first copies the bytes and
the binding then establishes and allocates persistent CFI storage with that
runtime width. This is a named lowering method under the same result handle
plan, not a separate string-result ownership hierarchy.

Legacy oracle:

- binding `_bind_owned_allocatable_result_handle`, owned-result operation
  builders, `_bind_materialized_native_array_handle_result`, and destroy body;
- bridge `_bridge_owned_allocatable_result_handle` plus allocatable result
  helper/copy logic; and
- the runtime handle factory and exactly-once `close()`/finalizer protocol.

- [x] Attach one `NativeArrayHandlePlan` with `OWNED_RESULT_STORAGE` to direct
  and hidden `ResultPlan` owners; hidden outputs share their exact descriptor
  native slot.
- [x] Use `CodegenAction.WRAPPER_INSTANCE` and an explained
  `COPY_REPRESENTATION` only for materialization into persistent owner storage;
  source hiddenness remains `source_kind`, not a codegen action.
- [x] Record owner storage, materialization, handle construction, ownership
  transfer, destroy behavior, and release responsibility under the result's
  typed handle plan. Keep backend-local CFI allocation/copy/free nodes inside
  the selected result lowerer rather than fabricating lifecycle policy records.
- [x] Require generated `shape`, `array_actual`, `descriptor`, extraction/state,
  allowed mutation, and `destroy` operations before publishing the handle.
- [x] Validate CFI rank, dtype, element length, allocated state, owner
  retention, release responsibility, destroy behavior, and all success/failure
  paths before emission.
- [x] Add `owned-allocatable-results` and
  `owned-allocatable-hidden-outputs` support lanes after reduced parity from
  `test_array_results_follow_data_buffer_and_descriptor_handle_contracts`,
  `test_output_arguments_and_multiple_results_follow_python_projection_rules`,
  and `test_allocatable_module_fields_and_results_expose_lifetime_safe_handles`.
- [x] Keep pointer result tests on their explicit policy blocker; do not make
  their matrix rows `wrapper-plan` merely because allocatable results pass.

### Phase 7F — Borrowed Module Handles And Generated Operations

Included: rank-positive allocatable and pointer module variables exposed as one
stable borrowed handle object at module initialization. Repeated attribute reads
return the same handle. Replacement assignment is rejected. The generated
operation table accesses current native state and includes only operations
allowed by completed policy.

Allocatable operations include allocation state, shape, array actual,
descriptor handoff, extraction, deallocation, and resize where allowed. Pointer
operations include association state, shape, array actual, descriptor handoff,
nullification, extraction, and policy-gated allocation/deallocation/resize.
Borrowed module handles retain the Python module and never destroy native-owned
descriptor storage.

Deferred-character handles also expose runtime `element_length`. Shape-only
`allocate` and `resize` operations are omitted because they cannot state the
new character width; native procedures that declare the width remain the
authoritative mutation path.

Legacy oracle: the bridge's `_native_array_module_handle`,
`_native_array_module_handle_operations`, and operation-specific module methods;
the binding's `_bind_borrowed_native_array_module_handle`, operation wrappers,
and handle creation; and the current runtime handle factory.

- [x] Add a native-handle getter action and one `NativeArrayHandlePlan` beneath
  `ModuleVariablePlan`; keep Python attribute exposure and native operation
  generation in its binding and bridge child views.
- [x] Plan operation roles and export names explicitly while leaving operation
  call locals backend-local. Do not store generated method names in the plan.
- [x] Validate stable handle identity, module owner retention, rejected
  replacement, descriptor kind, operation completeness, and borrowed/no-destroy
  lifecycle.
- [x] Add `allocatable-module-handles` and `pointer-module-handles` support
  lanes only after module-only reduced parity covers state changes, zero-length
  state, extraction policy, operation permissions, stale-view behavior, and
  module lifetime.
- [x] Use `test_allocatable_module_fields_and_results_expose_lifetime_safe_handles`,
  `test_plain_allocatable_module_array_exposes_current_live_view`,
  and the module portion of
  `test_module_and_derived_pointer_handles_track_native_association` as legacy
  oracles. Split out field/class assertions, which remain Phase 8/9 work.

#### Phase 7F Contract Correction — View-Only Module Extraction

The checked Phase 7F items above record the original migration slice; they do
not close this changed public contract. Complete this correction before Phase
8 implementation.

- [x] Update public docs, maintainer docs, generated/checked semantic `.pyi`
  evidence, and wrapper coverage rows to specify current live view or `None`,
  explicit `.copy()`, and the unsupported stale-view window.
- [x] Complete plain and `Aliased` allocatable module arrays as native-owned
  borrowed handles with the same extraction result. Keep addressability,
  descriptor mechanism, owner retention, mutability, nullability, storage,
  operation permissions, and release responsibility as separate completed
  facts.
- [x] Remove `read_only_detached_copy` and extraction-only `copy_only` policy,
  plan, runtime, binding, and bridge dispatch. Preserve only typed live-view
  mechanisms such as contiguous or standard-descriptor views; unsupported
  extraction fails instead of copying.
- [x] For a plain allocatable module array, add the completed standard-
  descriptor module-state mechanism needed to inspect the current allocation
  on each extraction. Keep it beneath `ModuleVariablePlan`; do not retain a
  descriptor or data address as if it were permanently current.
- [x] Keep binding/bridge ownership explicit: the bridge exposes current native
  descriptor facts without NumPy knowledge, and the binding validates
  dtype/rank/shape/strides and creates the NumPy view with its handle owner as
  the base. Native-handle argument handoff must not call `to_numpy()`.
- [x] Replace the obsolete read-only-copy test with source/generated-`.pyi`
  parity covering plain and `Aliased` live mutation, allocated/unallocated and
  associated/unassociated state, fresh extraction after state changes,
  explicit-copy independence, stale-view documentation, parent/owned-result
  retention, and contiguous/strided pointer views.
- [x] Rerun focused policy/plan/backend/runtime tests, documentation checks,
  the wrapper suite excluding LAPACK, the wrapper-codegen complexity checker,
  and the required static-analysis suite before closing Phase 7 again.

### Phase 7G — Pointer Descriptor Extraction And Build Requirements

Included: pointer `descriptor_view`, `contiguous_view`, and explicitly
unsupported extraction actions already selected by completed policy; standard
descriptor decoding; positive and negative strides; and local build/header
requirements. A `copy_only` `to_numpy()` action is obsolete and must not reach
the corrected plan.

Descriptor views, the corrected plain allocatable module-state path, and
persistent allocatable owner storage require standard C descriptor support.
Generated code may read `CFI_cdesc_t` through `ISO_Fortran_binding.h` when the
completed plan requests it. It must never guess or expose a compiler-private
descriptor layout. Unsupported toolchains fail readiness/build with the
completed owner path and requirement.

- [x] Carry typed extraction and descriptor-interop actions plus required
  headers into handle/module/result plans and rendered artifact metadata.
- [x] Reuse the runtime descriptor-view helper for shape, stride, buffer-window,
  dtype, rank, and null-address validation; direct C lowering only decodes the
  standard descriptor fields into its expected mapping.
- [x] Add directly named C descriptor-reader and operation-wrapper methods;
  decoded dimension objects and mapping temporaries remain binding-local.
- [x] Validate that build requirements equal the union of completed plans,
  appear in replayable manifests, and do not leak into wrappers that need only
  ordinary buffers or non-CFI borrowed allocatable handles.
- [x] Replay
  `test_pointer_descriptor_views_preserve_slice_shape_strides_and_parent_lifetime`
  and `test_pyi_manifest_records_pointer_descriptor_interop_requirements`, plus
  focused `tests/runtime/handles`, before enabling
  `pointer-descriptor-extraction`.
- [x] Preserve the explicit readiness failure when required C descriptor
  support is unavailable; no contiguous-copy fallback may be inferred in the
  backend.

### Phase 7H — Remaining Rank-Zero Descriptor Results And Strings

Phase 3 already owns ordinary and optional scalar descriptor inputs, including
omitted/present-null/present-value state. Phase 4 already owns nullable scalar
descriptor module reads as copied Python snapshots. Do not rebuild those paths
or turn rank-zero descriptors into runtime handle objects.

Included here: direct scalar descriptor function results, hidden scalar
descriptor outputs, projected scalar descriptor readback, and allocatable or
pointer scalar character results with runtime/deferred length. The Python result
is `T | None` or `String | None`; absent allocation/association returns `None`.
An allocated/associated value is copied exactly once before the call-local or
native descriptor is released. Deferred-length strings use runtime element
length and preserve the existing encoding/byte contract.

- [x] Add a subordinate scalar-descriptor handoff/result record to the existing
  scalar or string `ArgumentTransferPlan`/`ResultPlan`; do not attach
  `NativeArrayHandlePlan` or use `ObjectKind.NUMPY_ARRAY` for rank zero.
- [x] Complete result source, descriptor kind, presence, runtime element length,
  copy action/reason, release owner, and failure cleanup in wrapper policy before
  planning.
- [x] Reuse existing Phase 3 presence records and typed lifecycle ordering;
  extend named scalar/string result lowering only for the descriptor producer
  and copy/release steps.
- [x] Validate direct versus hidden descriptor source, nullable result spelling,
  result ordering, runtime string length, null state, copy count, and cleanup on
  conversion/status failure.
- [x] Add isolated legacy/direct parity for numeric allocatable and pointer
  results and for `string_result_deferred` from
  `test_modern_fortran_character_arguments_and_results`, including an absent
  result and non-ASCII encoded data.
- [x] Keep pointer array results blocked even after pointer scalar values pass;
  copied scalar readback does not prove array target lifetime.

### Derived Fields Remain A Recorded Later Dependency

The shared handle plan must be capable of recording
`borrowed_field_descriptor`, `owner_retention=parent_wrapper`, field operation
roles, and parent-owned destruction behavior. Do not add field/class traversal
or route eligibility in Phase 7. `BindCNativeArrayHandleProperty`, field
operation generation, and the field portions of allocatable/pointer tests remain
legacy oracles for Phases 8 and 9, where the owning wrapper instance and property
lifecycle exist in the plan.

This boundary prevents Phase 7 from either duplicating future `FieldPlan`
ownership or falsely marking mixed module-and-field generation units supported.

### Legacy Primitive Inventory And Rewrite Rule

| Primitive | Legacy source | Direct-plan treatment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Normal array handle actual | binding `_native_array_actual_argument_body`; runtime normal-array helpers | reuse runtime helper and Phase 6 bridge ABI; rewrite minimal binding nodes |
| Required/optional descriptor argument | binding descriptor argument helpers; bridge descriptor handlers | rewrite named direct methods around shared runtime packer and planned CFI roles |
| Projected writable descriptor | binding direct descriptor handler; bridge descriptor projection | rewrite direct pointer handoff and identity lifecycle; no fact-packed fallback |
| Owned allocatable result | binding owned-result/operation helpers; bridge allocatable result helper | rewrite minimal CFI owner-storage and result lifecycle nodes; assign once locally and transfer the allocation into the CFI-backed output dummy with `move_alloc` |
| Borrowed module handle | binding handle creation/operation wrappers; bridge module operations | rewrite under `ModuleVariablePlan`; reuse runtime factory |
| Pointer descriptor view | binding descriptor reader; runtime view helper | reuse runtime view helper; rewrite only standard-descriptor decoding nodes |
| Scalar descriptor result | legacy scalar descriptor/result conversion | extend existing scalar/string plan route; do not create an array handle |
| Build requirement | semantic `native_array_handle_build_requirements`; build manifest | reuse completed requirements and carry them through rendered artifacts |

For every primitive, first retain generated legacy C/Fortran/header artifacts
from the cited passing wrapper test. Explain each material direct-plan artifact
difference before compilation. Copy a small legacy method only when it already
matches the direct node API and complexity limit; otherwise rewrite the minimal
equivalent. Do not copy legacy dispatcher classes, scope mutation machinery, or
datatype/policy inference.

### Route And Test Migration Matrix For Phase 7

Mixed rows retain their later derived/field owners. The dependency-closed
Phase 7 rows were split, proved through both routes, and then recorded as
`wrapper-plan` in the complete ledger.

| Existing node or group | Current role/status | Phase 7 owner and target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `arrays/test_array_results.py::test_array_results_follow_data_buffer_and_descriptor_handle_contracts[*]` | ordinary/allocatable result generation unit; `wrapper-plan` | Phase 6 ordinary and Phase 7E allocatable results now share the production plan route |
| `build_from_pyi/test_pyi_wrapper_builds.py::test_pyi_manifest_records_pointer_descriptor_interop_requirements` | non-generating manifest policy; `not-applicable` | Phase 7G plan/header union is covered by direct generated-artifact tests |

| `module_state/test_allocatable_views.py::test_plain_allocatable_module_array_exposes_current_live_view[*]` | corrected source/generated-`.pyi` production-plan evidence | proves Phase 7F plain/`Aliased` current live-view or `None` parity, native mutation, explicit-copy independence, and fresh extraction after state changes |
| `strings/test_character_arguments.py::test_modern_fortran_character_arguments_and_results[*]` | fixed strings plus deferred allocatable result; `legacy` | Phase 7H reduced deferred-result parity; retain mixed row as needed |
| `edit_pyi_contracts/test_native_order_contracts.py::test_editable_contract_can_use_native_order_arguments_without_native_call` | includes raw `Addr(Float64[n])` plus a derived result; `legacy` | raw-array subset is the completed Phase 6G prerequisite; derived subset remains Phase 8 |

| Completed sub-lane | Dependency-closed compiled evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Phase 7A, 7B, 7F, and 7G | `derived_types/test_pointers.py::test_module_native_array_handles_use_canonical_plan` |
| Phase 7C | `function_calls/test_optional_arguments.py::test_optional_array_descriptors_preserve_presence_and_storage_state` |

Required focused intermediate coverage includes:

- completed semantic handle/interop policy projection tests;
- editable plan tests for every descriptor kind, handoff form, operation set,
  ownership, optional presence state, and lifecycle edit;
- C and Fortran preflight rejection of mismatched or incomplete descriptor
  plans;
- generated artifact assertions for standard descriptor fields, optional
  presence, operation functions, owner storage, destroy paths, and local header
  requirements;
- runtime helper tests under `tests/runtime/handles` without duplicating their
  validation in wrapper-codegen tests; and
- compiled legacy/direct parity for each reduced sub-lane before any migration
  ledger or production-route change.

### Phase 7 Completion

- [x] Expand Phase 7 under the mandatory gate using the live completed policy,
  runtime handle implementation, legacy backends, build integration, public
  contract, and focused wrapper tests.
- [x] Complete the shared typed handle, array-actual, and descriptor-handoff
  plan records without adding a parallel top-level plan hierarchy.
- [x] Complete every missing semantic selector before `ir2ast.py`; remove
  bridge-created `ArrayInteropPolicy` and fabricated semantic ownership choices.
- [x] Finish Phases 7A through 7H individually with legacy artifact capture,
  direct lowering, validation, compiled parity, route evidence, and matrix
  updates.
- [x] Preserve the completed Phase 6G raw-address boundary while keeping every
  derived-field, pointer-result, callback, and deferred-real-library exclusion
  on its explicit later blocker.
- [x] Complete the Phase 7F view-only correction for plain and `Aliased`
  allocatable module arrays and remove every implicit-copy extraction path.
- [x] Rerun focused policy/plan/backend tests, relevant runtime-handle tests,
  documentation checks, the wrapper suite excluding LAPACK, the wrapper-codegen
  complexity checker, and the required static-analysis suite after the
  correction.
- [x] Close Phase 7 only when every live non-field native-handle/descriptor case
  is migrated or explicitly removed from the product contract, and no backend
  infers descriptor policy or silently substitutes a data buffer, raw pointer,
  `.to_numpy()` extraction, or copy fallback.

Historical pre-correction evidence: 538 focused semantic/policy/plan/backend/
runtime tests, 1,133 documentation and layout tests, and all 318 wrapper tests
outside the deferred BLAS/LAPACK file passed. The wrapper-codegen complexity
check, Ruff, formatting, Bandit, Vulture, whitespace, and explicit-base Radon
policy also passed. This evidence remains valid for unaffected sub-lanes but is
not closure evidence for the changed view-only extraction contract. Record a
new success signal after the Phase 7F correction.

Post-correction closure evidence (2026-07-14): 214 focused runtime-handle,
policy, readiness, lowering, legacy-dispatch, and Phase 7 direct-plan tests;
199 complete `tests/wrapper_codegen` tests; 1,123 documentation tests; 317
wrapper tests outside the shared real-library parameter plus the BLAS-only
parameter; and zero locally executed LAPACK tests all passed. The wrapper
complexity checker, Ruff lint/format, Bandit, Vulture, whitespace, and the
explicit-`origin/main` Radon policy passed. The required `--base-ref auto`
Radon invocation could not resolve a CI base SHA locally; the explicit base
rerun passed. Advisory full Radon complexity and maintainability reports were
also produced.

Phase 7 was re-verified again with the final Phase 8 closure run on
2026-07-15: the 704-test semantic/policy/plan/backend regression batch, all 79
runtime-handle tests, 1,123 documentation tests, and all 326 wrapper tests
outside LAPACK passed. No LAPACK test was run locally.

## Phase 8 — Derived Types And Object Lifetimes

Expansion status: complete. Implementation proceeds only after the Phase 7
view-only correction is re-verified.

Implementation status: reopened for the complete rank-zero scalar-derived
actual/dummy compatibility matrix in Phase 8H. The previous Phase 8A-I
evidence remains authoritative for unaffected fields and lifecycle paths, but
the old module-allocatable rejection, nonreassociating pointer-only path,
interoperable-only value restriction, and incomplete module-object call routes
are superseded. Phase 8 must not close again until direct, scoped-address,
wrapper-holder, module-transaction, pointer-input, and typed-value actions are
implemented without a fallback and re-verified with multi-argument calls.

Scope: migrate scalar derived-type storage, arguments, results, borrowed
objects, and field handoffs into the wrapper-plan route. Phase 8 owns the
opaque native-instance substrate and the typed transfers that use it. Phase 9
owns public constructors, methods, overloads, inheritance, and general
class-surface orchestration built on that substrate. Phase 8 owns public field
descriptors and their typed getters/setters because every live object origin,
including plain module proxies, needs the same readable and writable member
surface.

Do not begin implementation while a Phase 7 native-array-handle correction is
open. In particular, Phase 8 must consume the final view-only `to_numpy()`
contract: an array-handle extraction is a live view or `None`, and an
independent array is obtained with an explicit `.copy()`.

`Snapshot[T]` is no longer an active public contract. Plain and `Aliased`
rank-zero derived module variables both expose the normal live generated object
surface. Their lowering mechanisms remain distinct: `Aliased` proves a direct
address-backed borrow, while a plain declaration requires typed module-specific
bridge access and must not fabricate a native address. `Aliased` remains an
addressability and aliasing fact for raw-address legality, pointer association,
C-pointer policy, and direct derived-object handoff; it does not select
array-handle `to_numpy()` behavior.

### Phase 8 Boundary And Explicit Non-Scope

The first implementation slice is rank-zero, non-polymorphic derived values.
The runtime wrapper is opaque: the binding carries a native address, ownership
state, and an optional retained Python owner, while the bridge performs typed
native association, assignment, allocation, and destruction. The binding must
not depend on component offsets or reproduce native aggregate layout.

The following surfaces are in Phase 8:

- required and optional scalar derived arguments;
- visible `out` and `inout` wrappers whose identity remains caller-visible;
- hidden output and direct-function-result values materialized as
  wrapper-owned instances;
- native `value` arguments for an exact rank-zero monomorphic derived type,
  using a Fortran bridge-owned typed value copy rather than C-side layout
  inference; the native type need not be `bind(C)` when the bridge imports its
  exact definition;
- derived `parameter` and other explicit constant-value origins materialized
  through the existing wrapper-owned immutable-value path, never as a fallback
  for an ordinary mutable module object;
- plain rank-zero native module objects exposed as live module-backed proxies
  through typed bridge operations;
- `Aliased` rank-zero native module objects exposed as live borrowed wrappers;
- borrowed nested component wrappers, their public field descriptors, and the
  owner-retention facts required by those descriptors;
- Phase 7 allocatable/pointer field-handle plans attached to a derived owner;
- exact destruction, finalization, cleanup, and failure ownership for each of
  those origins.

The following remain outside Phase 8:

- public default/keyword constructors, explicit `@bind(...)` constructors,
  `tp_init`, methods, static methods, overload dispatch, Python inheritance,
  and ordinary type-bound surface assembly; these remain Phase 9. Public field
  descriptors, getters, and setters are Phase 8 and are not a Phase 9 blocker.
  A generated semantic `.pyi` field constructor is therefore a whole-unit
  Phase 9 blocker; only an opaque contract that suppresses default construction
  may use the direct Phase 8 object route;
- scalar polymorphic dispatch and inheritance even where the legacy route
  supports them; Phase 9 owns the class relationship needed to validate the
  accepted runtime type set;
- callback-derived arguments and results, adapter procedures, and trampoline
  ownership; these remain Phase 10;
- arrays of derived values, whose element layout, construction, destruction,
  copy, and partial-failure behavior remain explicit readiness blockers;
- polymorphic results, mutable polymorphic arguments, `class(*)`, abstract
  instantiation, deferred bindings, and allocatable/pointer polymorphic
  scalars;
- polymorphic descriptor-backed scalars. Wrapper-owned allocatable and pointer
  holders plus scalar derived module ordinary/`TARGET`/allocatable/pointer
  variables are supported only by their explicit Phase 8H matrix rows. A
  pointer holder owns its association container, never its target by default;
  target retention and native release responsibility are completed separately
  before lowering. Module allocation and pointer transactions use shared typed
  holder addresses in interoperable callbacks, never CFI or a compiler-private
  descriptor;
- any other derived origin that cannot use one of the explicit matrix rows. It
  remains blocked rather than being silently turned into an address-backed
  borrow or detached object;
- C-side aggregate casts, `ctypes` layout promises, compiler-private descriptor
  inspection, or direct component offsets;
- ownership of targets reachable through pointer components. A containing
  derived wrapper does not own such a target without completed pointer policy;
  and
- detached whole-object snapshot classes or recursive member-copy graphs. They
  are removed rather than retained as a compatibility path.

### Public Representation And Lifetime Matrix

Complete this matrix in post-IR policy before adding planner or backend code.
The rows are distinct origins, not datatype guesses made during lowering.

| Surface | Python representation | Native handoff/storage | Owner and release |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| required `in` argument | existing wrapper instance | pass its opaque wrapper address and associate a typed native view for the call | wrapper remains owned by its existing Python object; call destroys nothing |
| required visible `inout` or caller-supplied `out` | same wrapper instance | pass the same address for native mutation | caller-visible wrapper retains identity; its normal wrapper finalizer remains the sole destroyer |
| optional argument, omitted or `None` | no wrapper instance | explicit absence token/branch; no fabricated native object | no allocation or cleanup |
| optional argument, present | validated wrapper instance | same typed address handoff as the required case | existing wrapper owner remains responsible |
| hidden output | new opaque wrapper object | allocate persistent wrapper-owned native storage before the call and pass its address | wrapper deallocator invokes native-aware destruction exactly once |
| direct function result | new opaque wrapper object | move or copy the native result before its temporary expires into persistent wrapper-owned storage | wrapper deallocator invokes native-aware destruction exactly once |
| constructor-created instance | Phase 9 only | Phase 9 must allocate through the same persistent wrapper-owned storage and native-aware destructor established here | explicitly blocked until Phase 9 class construction orchestration; no Phase 8 fallback constructor |
| native `value` input | existing wrapper instance | exact Fortran bridge passes the typed pointee to the native by-value slot; C never lays out or copies the aggregate | call-local native copy only; wrapper ownership is unchanged |
| plain rank-zero module variable | normal live generated object | module-specific typed getter/setter operations plus a synchronous scoped-address consumer when the object is passed to another procedure | native module owns storage; wrapper retains the module and never destroys storage; a temporary target/address cannot escape its consumer scope |
| `Aliased` or explicit `TARGET` rank-zero module variable | live borrowed wrapper | use `C_LOC` as the sole whole-object handoff; reconstruct the exact typed bridge view without copying | native module owns storage; wrapper never destroys it and rejects replacement |
| derived `parameter` or other explicit constant-value origin | wrapper-owned value copy with an immutable module binding | materialize the native value into persistent wrapper-owned storage | wrapper destroys only its materialized copy; no native module setter; normal writable fields modify only that independent copy |
| nested derived field | live borrowed child wrapper | address/alias of the component through the parent wrapper | child retains parent; child never destroys component storage |
| allocatable scalar derived module origin | nullable live module-backed proxy carrying its runtime origin | scoped-address consumer for payload-only calls; for an allocatable dummy, module-specific interoperable operations move between the module variable and a bridge-local shared typed holder addressed by `C_PTR` | native module owns storage before and after a transaction; successful move-out has exactly one reverse-order move-back; no descriptor crosses C |
| pointer scalar derived module origin | nullable live module-backed proxy carrying its runtime origin | current-target address for payload-only calls; for a pointer dummy, a bridge-local shared typed pointer holder receives the initial association and its address is passed to the module-specific restore operation | native module owns the pointer variable and, by default, its target; final association is restored exactly once after a normally returning native call |
| wrapper-owned allocatable scalar derived result | nullable live generated wrapper backed by one persistent typed allocatable holder per native type | result is moved into `holder%value`; ordinary, target, allocatable, allocatable-target, pointer-input, and value dummies use the explicit compatible matrix actions | each Python wrapper owns one target-capable holder and destroys it exactly once; allocation-state writeback preserves wrapper identity |
| wrapper-owned pointer scalar derived result | nullable live generated wrapper backed by one persistent typed pointer holder per native type | holder component stores current association and is passed directly to a compatible pointer dummy; payload-only calls use its associated target | wrapper owns and destroys only the holder; target ownership stays native unless completed policy retains a known wrapper/module target; destruction nullifies the component and never deallocates an unowned target |
| detached whole-object snapshot | removed | no recursive copy graph or snapshot helper is generated | no compatibility parser, lowering, or fallback; read the live object through normal fields instead |

`Aliased` remains a public, language-neutral addressability/aliasing fact and
must survive parsing, semantic IR, and printing. For derived module objects it
distinguishes direct-address lowering from module-proxy lowering, not live
versus copied public behavior. It must never be reused to select live versus
copied native-array-handle extraction.

### Existing Semantic Authority And Legacy Oracle

Use the current implementation as an oracle, not as permission to preserve its
architecture:

- `x2py/semantics/ownership.py` already names `DERIVED_TYPE`,
  `PASS_WRAPPER_ADDRESS`, `WRAPPER_INSTANCE`, and `BORROWED_VIEW`, and contains
  the current argument/result/module/field owner defaults. Remove the obsolete
  derived whole-object snapshot action without disturbing ordinary result
  copies, scalar descriptor value copies, or explicit non-object uses of
  `snapshot_copy` transfer policy.
- `x2py/semantics/policy_completion.py` is the only allowed owner of origin,
  ownership, transfer, destruction, mutability, nullability, projection,
  release, storage, getter/setter, owner-retention, module-object handoff, and
  field decisions. It must complete module-proxy policy for plain module
  objects and direct-address borrowed policy for `Aliased` module objects.
- `x2py/semantics/wrapper_policy.py` must gain a derived-specific policy branch.
  Derived values must not continue through primitive-scalar blockers,
  primitive result checks, or primitive bridge data-action selection.
- `x2py/semantics/ir2ast.py` and the legacy generators remain the generated
  artifact oracle. Direct lowering must not call `semantic_ir_to_codegen_ast()`
  or reconstruct legacy codegen variables.
- `x2py/codegen/bindings/c_to_python.py` contains the existing wrapper-instance
  conversion, checked casts, owned/borrowed result construction, owner
  retention, and allocator/destructor helpers. Remove recursive snapshot
  construction rather than migrating it into the direct route.
- `x2py/codegen/bridges/fortran_to_c.py` contains the existing typed wrapper
  address conversion, native result materialization, borrowed field/module
  access, native-aware destruction, and typed component getters/setters. Reuse
  those live member-access mechanics as the artifact oracle while moving every
  decision into typed plans.

Capture complete legacy artifacts before each direct slice. Preserve observable
runtime behavior while replacing backend inference with completed typed plans.
Do not copy the broad legacy generator control flow into `wrapper_codegen`.

The existing wrapper tests decompose as follows:

| Existing test or generation unit | Phase 8 oracle | Required split or later owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `function_calls/test_native_call_examples.py::test_native_call_examples_cover_scalar_array_string_and_object_projection[*]` | hidden derived result selected by `Return(...)` | add a reduced object-result entry; retain the mixed unit until every included lane is direct |
| `function_calls/test_output_arguments.py::test_output_arguments_and_multiple_results_follow_python_projection_rules[*]` | hidden derived output and mixed result aggregation | add a reduced derived-output entry; retain the broad unit until its complete tuple is direct |
| `edit_pyi_contracts/test_policy_dispatch_contracts.py::test_immutable_scalar_string_array_and_derived_policies_return_replacements` | edited projected derived replacement | isolate `make_point` as Phase 8 evidence; retain the mixed policy unit until whole-unit eligibility follows |
| `derived_types/test_derived_type_boundaries.py::test_scalar_derived_types_cross_procedure_boundaries[*]` | required input, in-place mutation, hidden/direct result, nested borrowed component | reduce first to result-created opaque objects passed back to `point_sum`/`move_point`; field descriptors and nested borrowing are Phase 8, while construction remains Phase 9 |
| `function_calls/test_optional_arguments.py::test_optional_arguments_drive_fortran_present_behavior[*]` | optional derived input and exact type/absence behavior | complete the optional transfer in Phase 8; the existing constructor-dependent broad runtime unit remains Phase 9 until it can route whole |
| `module_state/test_module_state.py::test_aliased_derived_module_object_borrows_native_state[*]` | native-owned borrowed module object and replacement rejection | use as the direct-address oracle; add a reduced plain-module proxy case with the same live field behavior; methods remain Phase 9 |
| `derived_types/test_borrowed_finalizers.py::test_borrowed_child_wrapper_never_finalizes_native_component[*]` | parent retention and exactly-once owner finalization | Phase 8 owns storage/lifetime plans and public field descriptors; constructor/method orchestration remains Phase 9 |
| `module_state/test_allocatable_views.py::test_allocatable_module_fields_and_results_expose_lifetime_safe_handles[*]` | Phase 7 field handle attached to a derived owner | reuse the existing `NativeArrayHandlePlan` and expose its public property in Phase 8 |
| `derived_types/test_pointers.py::test_pointer_descriptor_views_preserve_slice_shape_strides_and_parent_lifetime` | pointer field handle and parent lifetime | reuse Phase 7 descriptor extraction; do not move pointer target ownership into Phase 8 |
| `derived_types/test_derived_layout.py::test_bind_c_derived_types_use_accessors_and_fortran_value_copy[*]` | opaque `bind(C)` wrapper, field accessors, and typed native `value` copy | Phase 8 owns the handoff and field properties; constructor orchestration remains Phase 9 |
| former `module_state/contracts/fmodule_derived_snapshot_f90/` snapshot fixture | obsolete detached-object behavior | remove the `Snapshot[box]` fixture and snapshot-only runtime assertions; reuse the native unit only for reduced live module-proxy evidence where applicable |
| `derived_types/test_constructors_and_finalizers.py::*`, `derived_types/test_derived_type_methods.py::*`, and `derived_types/test_inheritance.py::*` | owned-instance finalizer and type facts may inform Phase 8 | production migration remains Phase 9 because the observable unit is constructor/method/property/inheritance owned |
| `callbacks/test_derived_callbacks.py::*` | none | remain Phase 10 even after ordinary derived transfers are complete |

The plain non-target module-object row has one recorded intentional correction:
the legacy whole-object getter attempts `c_loc` on storage without the required
addressability property and therefore has no passing whole-object artifact.
Phase 8 uses the real source declaration, the passing legacy typed component
getters/setters, and the passing `Aliased` direct-address behavior as its
mechanical oracles, then improves the plain path to a typed member proxy. The
compiled Phase 8 evidence asserts that this proxy never emits a fabricated
whole-object `c_loc` while its reads and writes remain live.

### Mandatory Phase 8 Migration Algorithm

Apply this same sequence to every dependency-closed sub-lane. A checked item in
a later step cannot compensate for an incomplete earlier step.

1. Capture the complete generated artifacts and runtime assertions from one
   real passing legacy/source case. Record which constructor/method or
   callback assertions remain outside the reduced unit.
2. Complete object kind, origin, ownership, transfer, destruction, mutability,
   nullability, projection, storage, release, owner retention, getter/setter,
   native assignment, and any module-object mechanism before `ir2ast.py`.
3. Project those facts mechanically into `ArgumentTransferPlan`, `ResultPlan`,
   or `ModuleVariablePlan`, with native slots and lifecycle actions remaining
   subordinate references.
4. Validate type identity, roles, actions, owners, storage, result positions,
   releases, and cross-backend handoffs before either backend emits source.
5. Lower through small named binding and bridge methods selected by typed
   object kind and action. Backend-local temporaries remain implementation
   details inside the already selected method.
6. Compare binding, bridge, header, and build artifacts with the captured
   oracle and explain every intentional difference before compiling.
7. Add focused policy, plan-edit, validation, printer, backend, runtime,
   documentation, and source/generated-`.pyi` parity tests.
8. Promote the reduced generation unit only after compiled legacy/direct parity
   passes; otherwise retain one exact blocker without a fallback route.

The maintainer trace is therefore always:

```text
completed semantic facts
  -> typed argument/result/module-variable plan
  -> subordinate native slots and lifecycle actions
  -> validation
  -> binding and bridge lowering
  -> generated artifacts
  -> compiled runtime evidence
```

### Plan Shape And Stable Action Vocabulary

Do not create a second function plan, a second result hierarchy, or a rendered
derived-plan layer. Extend the existing plan tree as follows:

- add one explicit derived datatype family or equivalent non-primitive marker
  so a derived semantic type never indexes the primitive scalar dtype maps;
- add a concise namespace-owned derived-type definition record containing
  canonical semantic/native identity, native scope, Python exports, opaque
  runtime type symbol, allocation role, destruction/finalization role, and the
  minimal field identities needed by later field plans;
- add one `DerivedHandoffPlan`-style facet, analogous to `ArrayHandoffPlan`, to
  `ArgumentTransferPlan`, `ResultPlan`, `ModuleVariablePlan`, and the owning
  `NativeCallSlotPlan` only where that transfer needs it;
- give a derived `ModuleVariablePlan` one typed module-object access facet that
  records the completed direct-address or opaque-callback mechanism, its
  context/address roles, compiler capability, and module-lifetime owner. This
  mechanism is subordinate to the module-variable policy and must not change
  its public borrowed-wrapper facts;
- keep native slot order, symbolic roles, and ABI positions subordinate to the
  owning argument or result transfer;
- represent result destruction, failed-construction cleanup, parent retention,
  through transfer-owned `LifecycleActionPlan` records in function-wide
  execution order;
- add field-handoff records beneath the owning derived-type definition. Do not
  put their ownership decisions into a backend registry; and
- keep `FunctionPlan`, `ModulePlan`, namespace assembly, result ordering, GIL
  envelope, and status-error behavior stable.

Reuse the existing action vocabulary:

- Python boundary: `WRAPPER_INSTANCE` for accepted live wrapper objects and
  `NONE` for native-produced results;
- native boundary: `PASS_WRAPPER_ADDRESS` for opaque live objects and `NONE`
  when the bridge itself owns result production; module-backed proxies use a
  distinct typed module-origin handoff rather than a fabricated address;
- transfer/codegen: `CALL_LOCAL_INPUT`, `IN_PLACE_ARGUMENT`,
  `IDENTITY_OUTPUT`, `WRAPPER_INSTANCE`, and `BORROWED_VIEW` according to the
  completed matrix row;
- bridge data: `DIRECT_TRANSFER`, `ASSOCIATE_VIEW`, or
  `COPY_REPRESENTATION`, with a completed copy reason only when a real native
  representation copy occurs; and
- lifecycle: existing ordered copy-in/native-mutation/copy-out/cleanup phases,
  extended only with a genuinely missing release phase/action rather than a
  derived-only parallel lifecycle system.

If one of these actions cannot express a required operation, document the
missing semantic distinction before adding exactly one typed action. Do not use
method-name strings, datatype conditionals, `intent`, `is_alias`, dotted-name
shape, or local temporary existence as hidden dispatch.

### Binding, Bridge, And Validation Ownership

| Layer | Owns | Must not own |
| --- | --- | --- |
| post-IR policy | origin, dynamic/static type allowance, owner, transfer, destruction, mutability, projection, nullability, storage, owner retention, getter/setter behavior, and blockers | emitted local names or source syntax |
| wrapper planner | mechanical projection into derived type/handoff facets, native roles, ordered results, and lifecycle indexes | new ownership or lifetime decisions |
| binding lowering | exact Python type checks, opaque wrapper address extraction, Python wrapper allocation, retained-owner references, result aggregation, and Python reference cleanup | native component layout, native assignment, or native finalization semantics |
| bridge lowering | typed association from opaque addresses, exact Fortran-owned `value` calls, native instance allocation/assignment, module/component access, and native-aware destruction/finalization | Python classes, C aggregate layout, reference counting, detached-copy fallback, or ownership inference |
| plan validation | matching type identity, roles, actions, owners, releases, result positions, and cross-backend handoffs before emission | fallback selection |

Validation must reject at least:

- a derived transfer without canonical type identity or an exported runtime
  wrapper type;
- a wrapper-address slot whose binding and bridge roles or ABI positions differ;
- a primitive scalar action or datatype family applied to `DERIVED_TYPE`;
- a wrapper-owned result without persistent storage, allocator, destroy action,
  or failure cleanup;
- a borrowed wrapper with a destroy action, or without its required native
  module/parent owner retention;
- a call-local argument that schedules destruction of the caller's wrapper;
- a visible in-place argument projected as a replacement without completed
  policy;
- a hidden output or direct result whose native temporary can escape by
  address;
- a plain module proxy without complete typed member-path operations, or an
  `Aliased` live module borrow without a completed direct-address handoff;
- binding and bridge module-object access roles that disagree;
- an obsolete `Snapshot` contract, recursive detached-copy action, or backend
  fallback that manufactures a detached object;
- a derived array or unsupported polymorphic form entering scalar-derived
  lowering; and
- any backend request to infer a class, owner, addressability, or release from
  semantic datatype or `intent`.

### Phase 8A — Contract, Origin, And Post-IR Policy Completion

Complete the semantic contract before defining direct plan records.

- [x] Inventory every live scalar derived origin from source and semantic
  `.pyi`: constructor-created storage, wrapper-owned result, caller-supplied
  argument, native module object, and nested component.
- [x] Introduce one typed completed origin/retention representation shared by
  class-instance, argument, result, module-variable, and field policy.
  Do not encode origins as ad hoc reason strings.
- [x] Keep generated and edited `.pyi` type identity stable across module
  namespaces, imported derived types, renamed Python exports, and same-name
  types from different native scopes.
- [x] Complete required, optional, visible `out`, visible `inout`, hidden
  output, and direct-result ownership without treating `intent` as the final
  Python signature. The editable signature and `@native_call(...)` projection
  decide visibility and order; policy only ensures the native call is valid.
- [x] Complete wrapper-owned result storage and destruction, borrowed
  module/field owner retention, native setter rejection, result projection,
  and failure cleanup before `ir2ast.py`.
- [x] Preserve `Aliased` parsing, printing, and source-derived metadata. Use it
  for a live derived-module borrow and direct-address legality, but never as a
  native-array extraction mode.
- [x] Complete a plain ordinary module object as `owner=NATIVE`,
  `transfer=BORROWED_VIEW`, native-owner destruction, module lifetime, module
  owner retention, typed member-path access, and replacement rejection. Do not
  claim or require a whole-object native address.
- [x] Complete an `Aliased` module object as `owner=NATIVE`,
  `transfer=BORROWED_VIEW`, native-owner destruction, alias storage, module
  owner retention, direct address acquisition, and replacement rejection.
- [x] Remove the obsolete public `Snapshot` keyword from `x2py.contracts`,
  parser, printer, generated `.pyi`, semantic IR, policy actions, legacy
  generators, documentation, and fixtures. Do not remove unrelated explicit
  copy-result or scalar descriptor value-copy policy.
- [x] Complete finite typed member-path traversal for plain module proxies.
  Memoize derived type identities so recursive graphs do not expand forever;
  require explicit pointer/allocatable association, ownership, and stale-child
  policy at recursive descriptor-backed edges.
- [x] Remove the obsolete wrapper-owned pointer-result blocker. Complete a
  persistent typed pointer-holder origin whose wrapper owns the holder but not
  its target, then keep only arrays of derived values and unsupported
  polymorphic forms on exact readiness blockers. Supported scalar module
  allocatable/`TARGET`/pointer origins use only their explicit Phase 8H
  actions.
- [x] Add focused parser, printer, source-conversion, ownership, accessor,
  policy-completion, and readiness tests for every active matrix row and
  blocker. Assert the deliberate module-proxy versus direct-address mechanism
  distinction, their shared live public behavior, and that neither changes a
  contained native handle's view-only extraction.

### Phase 8B — Derived Plan Records And Preflight Validation

- [x] Add the minimal namespace-owned opaque derived-type definition record and
  derived handoff facets described above. Keep all per-call decisions in
  `ArgumentTransferPlan`, `ResultPlan`, or `ModuleVariablePlan`.
- [x] Add an explicit derived datatype-family/type-reference representation so
  documentation, roles, native slots, lifecycle records, and printers never
  fall through primitive scalar maps.
- [x] Project class instance/self policies, native type identity, wrapper type
  symbol, native scope, allocator/destroy roles, and finalizer requirements
  mechanically from completed semantic policy.
- [x] Project optional presence, input/in-place/output action, native call
  position, ownership, storage, owner retention, and result position into the
  existing transfer records.
- [x] Share the exact `DerivedHandoffPlan` object with its owning
  `NativeCallSlotPlan` where the array/handle lanes already share subordinate
  facets; do not duplicate editable state.
- [x] Add recursive validation for the namespace type definitions, arguments,
  results, module variables, module-object access facets, field facets, and
  lifecycle indexes.
- [x] Make plan edits observable: changing a derived owner, action, type
  identity, retained owner, or release must either change both backend
  artifacts consistently or fail `_validate_plan()` before source emission.
- [x] Extend support analysis with precise derived lanes and blockers. Do not
  remove the blanket class-owner blocker until the minimal opaque type surface
  is direct and every remaining Phase 9 dependency is reported separately.
- [x] Add normal-print plan tests and direct generator preflight tests under
  `tests/wrapper_codegen/test_phase8_derived_types.py`.

### Phase 8C — Minimal Opaque Wrapper Storage And Lifecycle

This sub-lane creates the runtime substrate needed to return and pass opaque
objects. It does not implement public construction, fields, or methods by
itself; Phase 8F/H add the public field surface on this substrate.

- [x] Emit one minimal runtime wrapper type per exported semantic derived type,
  with an opaque native address, an owned/borrowed state, and an optional
  retained Python owner. Keep the public constructor unavailable until Phase 9.
- [x] Generate bridge allocation and destruction helpers from completed type
  policy. Native-aware destruction owns allocatable components and supported
  finalization; the binding must not free native storage directly.
- [x] Ensure owned allocation, initialization, and result conversion failures
  run native destruction and Python cleanup exactly once.
- [x] Ensure borrowed wrappers never run native destruction, including when
  their retained owner is released through cyclic or delayed garbage
  collection.
- [x] Register the minimal type in the correct exported namespace so result and
  module-variable materialization use the same class identity in source and
  generated-`.pyi` builds.
- [x] Keep wrapper struct/type declaration, allocation, owner retention, and
  destruction methods grouped under a derived-type comment in the binding;
  keep native allocate/associate/destroy helpers grouped likewise in the
  bridge.
- [x] Add source-printer and artifact tests for owned, borrowed, failed
  allocation, failed conversion, and exactly-once native destruction paths.

### Phase 8D — Wrapper-Owned Hidden Outputs And Function Results

- [x] Plan hidden `Return(...)` outputs and direct derived function results as
  `WRAPPER_INSTANCE` results with persistent wrapper-owned native storage.
- [x] For hidden output, allocate the result wrapper before the native call and
  pass its native address at the declared native slot. On failure, destroy it
  before returning the Python error.
- [x] For a function result, move or copy the returned native value into
  persistent wrapper-owned storage before the native temporary expires. Never
  retain an address into a bridge local.
- [x] Preserve result order and mixed-result aggregation through the existing
  `ResultPlan` and lifecycle sequence; do not special-case a derived result in
  function/module orchestration.
- [x] Reuse the same result type object and destructor for direct results,
  hidden outputs, and edited `Returns[...]` projections.
- [x] Add reduced legacy/direct compiled parity over the existing
  `make_point` cases in `test_native_call_examples.py`,
  `test_output_arguments.py`, and `test_derived_type_boundaries.py`, inspecting
  result storage, slot order, allocation failure, and cleanup artifacts.
- [x] Promote only those reduced generation units after both source and
  generated-`.pyi` routes return the correct opaque wrapper and finalization is
  proved. Field-based assertions remain on Phase 8F/H until their typed member
  operations are complete.

### Phase 8E — Required, Optional, In-Place, And Caller-Supplied Outputs

- [x] Accept only the exact completed wrapper type for a concrete derived
  argument. Subclass acceptance belongs to completed Phase 9 polymorphic
  policy, not normal Python `isinstance` convenience.
- [x] Extract the opaque native address in the binding and pass it through the
  single planned role. The bridge associates the matching typed native pointer
  and calls the native procedure without copying for ordinary reference
  arguments.
- [x] Preserve the same Python wrapper identity for visible `inout` and
  caller-supplied `out` arguments. Return it only when the edited projection
  requests that sole result; otherwise return `None`. Keep a mixed direct or
  hidden result plus visible derived writeback on an exact policy blocker until
  general mixed result/writeback aggregation is completed; do not let the
  direct route select it and then drop the wrapper identity.
- [x] Represent optional omission and explicit `None` as native absence. A
  present wrapper follows the same typed handoff as a required input; no empty
  wrapper or call-local default object may be fabricated.
- [x] Keep native slot order independent of normalized Python argument order
  and preserve user edits to argument visibility and projection.
- [x] Keep an immutable visible derived replacement on its existing exact
  blocker because no passing legacy contract defines its native copy and
  finalization semantics. Existing hidden/direct derived outputs use the owned
  result path completed in Phase 8D; do not mutate an immutable input or invent
  a generic object copy merely to remove the blocker.
- [x] Add focused type-error, optional-presence, wrong-wrapper-class,
  in-place-identity, caller-supplied-output, projection, and cleanup tests.
- [x] Add reduced compiled parity that creates a `point` through the Phase 8D
  result path, passes it to `point_sum`, mutates it through `move_point`, and
  observes the new value through another native call without requiring a
  constructor; the follow-on Phase 8F evidence also observes public fields.

### Phase 8F — Module Objects, Components, And Field Owners

- [x] Plan every eligible plain rank-zero derived module variable as a
  native-owned live module proxy with rejected replacement; plan every
  supported `Aliased` equivalent as a native-owned direct-address borrowed
  wrapper. Both retain the module and have no destroy action.
- [x] Preserve `Aliased` in generated semantic `.pyi` only when supplied by the
  native/source contract. Prove its module-proxy-versus-direct-address lowering
  meaning while separately proving that both are live and that it does not
  affect any contained native handle's view-only extraction.
- [x] Repeated `Aliased` module reads may create separate Python wrappers, but
  every wrapper must refer to the same native object and never claim ownership;
  repeated plain reads may create separate proxies, but every proxy must
  delegate to the same current native module object.
- [x] Plan a nested derived component as a borrowed wrapper whose retained
  owner is the containing wrapper. Releasing the parent name must not destroy
  the parent while a child wrapper remains live.
- [x] Ensure a borrowed child never invokes its own native finalizer; releasing
  the final child/owner reference triggers the containing owned instance's
  destruction exactly once.
- [x] Reuse the Phase 7 `NativeArrayHandlePlan` for allocatable/pointer fields,
  changing only origin=`derived_field`, owner retention=`parent_wrapper`, and
  the completed field operation roles. Do not create a derived-only handle.
- [x] Plan scalar, string, ordinary-array, nested-derived, and native-handle
  field getter/setter handoffs beneath the owning type for both address-backed
  and module-backed objects. Use typed bridge procedures rather than C layout
  offsets. Phase 8 emits both the typed low-level operations and public property
  descriptors, including setter exposure completed by semantic policy.
- [x] Traverse nested value components by finite member paths and type identity.
  Memoize recursive type definitions; recursive pointer/allocatable edges use
  their completed association and owner policy instead of unbounded flattening.
- [x] Preserve pointer-field target ownership and stale-view rules from
  completed pointer policy; parent retention does not make the parent own an
  external pointer target.
- [x] Add direct plan/backend lifetime tests, then reduced compiled evidence
  for the distinct plain proxy and `Aliased` direct-address origins, plus the
  borrowed-finalizer, allocatable-field, and pointer-field fixtures, without
  promoting constructor or method surfaces that remain Phase 9.

### Phase 8G — Exact Native `value` Copies And Opaque Layout

- [x] Preserve `bind(C)`/`sequence`/ordinary derived-type facts and native
  `value` transport through generated `Value(Arg(i))`, post-IR policy, and the
  derived handoff plan. Do not store this per-call ABI choice on the annotated
  Python type.
- [x] For every supported exact rank-zero monomorphic native `value` argument,
  keep Python on the opaque wrapper contract. The Fortran bridge imports the
  exact native type, reads the typed pointee, and performs the typed call. The
  binding and C boundary never cast, lay out, or byte-copy the aggregate.
- [x] Remove the obsolete requirement that the native type itself be
  interoperable. Ordinary, `sequence`, and `bind(C)` exact derived types use
  the same Fortran-owned typed-value action; polymorphic or unresolved native
  types remain exact blockers for type-identity reasons, not layout guesses.
- [x] Keep ordinary reference arguments and all component access on generated
  bridge helpers even when a type is `bind(C)`; interoperability does not turn
  fields into a public binary-layout promise.
- [x] Replace the obsolete unsupported-aggregate-layout assertions with
  policy, plan, artifact, and compiled tests for ordinary, `sequence`, and
  `bind(C)` exact typed value calls. Field-property assertions are Phase 8
  evidence; retain only constructor-dependent assertions in
  `test_derived_layout.py` for Phase 9 production promotion.

### Phase 8H — Direct-Address And Module-Proxy Object Access

This sub-lane supplies the distinct lowering mechanisms for the two completed
module-object origins in Phase 8A/8F: direct address acquisition for an
`Aliased` live borrow, and typed live member access for a plain module proxy.

- [x] Add one typed module-object access facet beneath `ModuleVariablePlan`.
  Record `DIRECT_ADDRESS` or `MODULE_PROXY`, the native object type, member-path
  operations, owner/release behavior, and failure behavior. Do not encode a
  backend method name.
- [x] Use the direct path only when completed source/semantic facts make the
  native address legal. The bridge exposes the opaque address mechanically;
  the binding constructs the borrowed wrapper and retains its module owner.
- [x] For a plain module object, use typed per-field bridge getters/setters and
  operations selected by the completed member graph. The binding constructs a
  module-retaining proxy with no native destroy action; every read observes
  current module state and every permitted write updates it.
- [x] Keep the initial direct-address and module-proxy paths rank-zero,
  nonallocatable, nonpointer, noncoindexed, and nonpolymorphic; the explicit
  descriptor-backed correction below adds only its named storage origins and
  call actions. Record exact blockers for
  unsupported type parameters, dynamic types, unresolved recursive pointer
  ownership, or any member without a complete live operation. Do not switch
  mechanisms as a fallback.
- [x] Validate direct-address roles or module-proxy member-operation coverage,
  exported wrapper type identity, owner/release behavior, and
  replacement rejection before either backend emits source.
- [x] Prove the `Aliased` address/lifetime premise and plain proxy live
  read/write behavior in focused compiled source/generated-`.pyi` tests.
- [x] Remove the `Snapshot` contract name, metadata, recursive copy policy,
  generated helper classes, documentation, and snapshot-only fixtures. Do not
  retain a compatibility parser, printer, alias, or backend fallback.
- [x] Preserve ordinary result materialization, explicit constant-value
  materialization, scalar descriptor value copies, ordinary array copy
  results, and any unrelated active transfer action. Their copy semantics are
  separate from removed whole-object snapshot behavior.
- [x] Replace the former plain-module snapshot fixture with source/generated-
  `.pyi` parity and runtime evidence for live scalar, string, ordinary-array,
  allocatable/pointer-handle, and nested-derived member paths, including
  recursive-edge blockers and parent/module retention.

#### Phase 8H Contract Correction — Complete Scalar-Derived Call Matrix

This correction replaces every earlier isolated module-allocatable, stable
pointer-target, direct-address-only, and interoperable-value proposal with one
complete compatibility matrix. It covers exact rank-zero, monomorphic
`type(item)` objects. Phase 9 still owns `class(item)`, inheritance, and dynamic
dispatch; arrays of derived values remain outside this matrix.

The actual declaration and its runtime origin are independent axes. The five
actual declaration forms are ordinary, `TARGET`, `ALLOCATABLE`,
`ALLOCATABLE,TARGET`, and `POINTER`; each can be module-owned or represented by
wrapper-owned storage where such storage is meaningful. The six native dummy
forms are:

| Key | Exact native dummy |
| --- | --- |
| `O` | `type(item) :: arg` |
| `T` | `type(item), target :: arg` |
| `A` | `type(item), allocatable :: arg` |
| `AT` | `type(item), allocatable, target :: arg` |
| `P` | `type(item), pointer :: arg` |
| `V` | `type(item), value :: arg` |

`OPTIONAL`, rank, and qualified type identity remain separate facts. Source
`INTENT` may propose the initial Python projection, but it is not a completed
matrix selector. For the `P` column, `Pointer(Arg(i))` without a matching
projected return selects a call-local pointer input adapter and discards native
reassociation. A matching `Returns[...]` selects association writeback and
therefore requires persistent pointer storage. x2py never selects between these
paths from native `INTENT`.

Use these completed action names. Parenthesized state requirements are runtime
preconditions, not alternative fallback actions:

| Action | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `DIRECT_REFERENCE` | wrapper-owned or direct module address; reconstruct the exact typed object and pass it by reference |
| `SCOPED_REFERENCE` | originating module synchronously invokes a generic address consumer; the native call completes before the temporary target scope returns |
| `HOLDER_REFERENCE` | reconstruct a persistent typed holder and pass its component directly |
| `MODULE_ADDRESS` | originating module returns `C_LOC` for an explicit durable target |
| `ALLOCATABLE_HOLDER` | pass a persistent wrapper-owned allocatable holder component directly, including unallocated state |
| `MODULE_ALLOCATABLE_TRANSACTION` | move between the module variable and a bridge-local shared typed transaction holder through interoperable holder-address operations |
| `POINTEE_REFERENCE` | pass the current target of a pointer holder or module pointer to a nonpointer dummy |
| `POINTER_HOLDER` | pass a persistent wrapper-owned pointer holder component directly so association writeback updates the same holder |
| `MODULE_POINTER_TRANSACTION` | initialize one bridge-local typed pointer holder from the current target and restore its final association through an interoperable holder-address operation |
| `POINTER_INPUT_ADAPTER` | expose a payload through a call-local pointer carrier because the Python contract does not project pointer association writeback |
| `TYPED_VALUE_COPY` | the exact Fortran bridge passes the typed object into the native `VALUE` slot; C never copies aggregate bytes |
| `INCOMPATIBLE` | language-level storage mismatch; raise the specified `TypeError` and never enter native code |

`[allocated]` means an allocated value is required. `[associated]` means an
associated pointer target is required. `A`, `AT`, and `P` descriptor calls
accept unallocated or disassociated state where the table does not carry one of
those preconditions.

| Actual declaration | Origin | `O` | `T` | `A` | `AT` | `P` | `V` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type(item) :: var` | non-module | `DIRECT_REFERENCE` | `DIRECT_REFERENCE` with call-scoped target | `INCOMPATIBLE` | `INCOMPATIBLE` | `POINTER_INPUT_ADAPTER` | `TYPED_VALUE_COPY` from direct reference |
| `type(item) :: var` | module proxy | `SCOPED_REFERENCE` | `SCOPED_REFERENCE` with call-scoped target | `INCOMPATIBLE` | `INCOMPATIBLE` | scoped `POINTER_INPUT_ADAPTER` | scoped `TYPED_VALUE_COPY` |
| `type(item), target :: var` | non-module | `DIRECT_REFERENCE` | `DIRECT_REFERENCE` with owner target lifetime | `INCOMPATIBLE` | `INCOMPATIBLE` | `POINTER_INPUT_ADAPTER` | direct `TYPED_VALUE_COPY` |
| `type(item), target :: var` | module | `MODULE_ADDRESS` | `MODULE_ADDRESS` with module target lifetime | `INCOMPATIBLE` | `INCOMPATIBLE` | `POINTER_INPUT_ADAPTER` | module-address `TYPED_VALUE_COPY` |
| `type(item), allocatable :: var` | non-module holder | `HOLDER_REFERENCE [allocated]` | `HOLDER_REFERENCE [allocated]` with holder target lifetime | `ALLOCATABLE_HOLDER` | `ALLOCATABLE_HOLDER` | holder `POINTER_INPUT_ADAPTER [allocated]` | holder `TYPED_VALUE_COPY [allocated]` |
| `type(item), allocatable :: var` | module | `SCOPED_REFERENCE [allocated]` | `SCOPED_REFERENCE [allocated]` with call-scoped target | `MODULE_ALLOCATABLE_TRANSACTION` | `MODULE_ALLOCATABLE_TRANSACTION` with call target | scoped `POINTER_INPUT_ADAPTER [allocated]` | scoped `TYPED_VALUE_COPY [allocated]` |
| `type(item), allocatable, target :: var` | non-module holder | `HOLDER_REFERENCE [allocated]` | `HOLDER_REFERENCE [allocated]` with holder target lifetime | `ALLOCATABLE_HOLDER` | `ALLOCATABLE_HOLDER` | holder `POINTER_INPUT_ADAPTER [allocated]` | holder `TYPED_VALUE_COPY [allocated]` |
| `type(item), allocatable, target :: var` | module | `MODULE_ADDRESS [allocated]` | `MODULE_ADDRESS` with module target lifetime | `MODULE_ALLOCATABLE_TRANSACTION` preserving target | `MODULE_ALLOCATABLE_TRANSACTION` preserving target | `POINTER_INPUT_ADAPTER [allocated]` | module-address `TYPED_VALUE_COPY [allocated]` |
| `type(item), pointer :: var` | non-module holder | `POINTEE_REFERENCE [associated]` | `POINTEE_REFERENCE [associated]` with retained target owner | `INCOMPATIBLE` | `INCOMPATIBLE` | `POINTER_HOLDER` | pointee `TYPED_VALUE_COPY [associated]` |
| `type(item), pointer :: var` | module | module `POINTEE_REFERENCE [associated]` | module `POINTEE_REFERENCE [associated]` with native target owner | `INCOMPATIBLE` | `INCOMPATIBLE` | `MODULE_POINTER_TRANSACTION` | module-pointee `TYPED_VALUE_COPY [associated]` |

An `Aliased` ordinary module object follows `MODULE_ADDRESS` instead of
`SCOPED_REFERENCE`, but its original target-lifetime fact still controls whether
a native pointer may outlive the call. This does not change `Aliased` array-view
semantics.

The matrix is exhaustive for this Phase 8 scope. Every cell becomes either one
completed action or one deliberate language-level error before lowering. No
backend may infer a different action from datatype, `intent`, module shape,
address presence, or local memory checks.

The table's `P` entries show the non-projecting input-adapter form. When the
Python contract projects pointer association writeback, replace every
nonpointer `P` cell with `INCOMPATIBLE`; the two pointer-storage rows retain
`POINTER_HOLDER` and `MODULE_POINTER_TRANSACTION`.

##### Shared Holder And Callback ABI

Define these support types once per qualified native derived type and import
the same definitions in every producer, origin operation, and consumer:

```fortran
type :: item_allocatable_holder
    type(item), allocatable :: value
end type

type :: item_pointer_holder
    type(item), pointer :: value => null()
end type
```

A persistent wrapper-owned holder is allocated through a Fortran pointer and
its opaque holder address is stored by the Python wrapper. Its nonpointer
allocatable component is a targetable subobject of the persistent holder
target, so the same carrier supports both `A` and `AT`; do not invent a second
allocatable-target holder.

Module allocation and pointer transactions use bridge-local holder objects
declared `TARGET`. The module-specific operations are interoperable
`BIND(C)` procedures taking only `type(C_PTR), value :: holder_address` plus
interoperable status/context values. Each operation reconstructs the exact
shared holder with `C_F_POINTER` and performs `MOVE_ALLOC` or pointer assignment
entirely in Fortran. The binding transports a typed function pointer and an
opaque holder address; no allocatable or pointer descriptor crosses C.

The old proposal to pass `type(item), allocatable` or `type(item), pointer`
directly through a runtime C callback is removed as noninteroperable. The old
proposal to avoid a transaction holder for module allocation/pointer restore is
also removed. A bridge-local transaction holder is the portable carrier; it is
not a persistent replacement for the originating module variable.

For a module allocatable transaction, the bridge performs the equivalent of:

```fortran
type(item_allocatable_holder), target :: transaction

status = move_out(c_loc(transaction))
if (status == X2PY_STATUS_OK) then
    call native_procedure(transaction%value)
    restore_status = move_back(c_loc(transaction))
end if
```

`move_out` executes `move_alloc(module_value, transaction%value)` and
`move_back` executes `move_alloc(transaction%value, module_value)`. A successful
move-out makes the module variable unavailable until restoration. When the
module actual has `TARGET`, both destinations preserve pointer association;
when it lacks `TARGET`, aliases created through a temporary target have only
call lifetime.

For a module pointer transaction, the bridge initializes
`transaction%value` from the current `C_LOC`/`C_NULL_PTR`, passes that component
to the native pointer dummy, and invokes `restore_pointer(c_loc(transaction))`.
The origin reconstructs the pointer holder and executes
`module_pointer => transaction%value`. The final nullification,
reassociation, allocation, or deallocation is therefore visible in the module
pointer.

Operation tables use typed C function-pointer fields; do not round-trip a
function pointer through `void *`. The proxy retains its originating extension
until every active scoped call or transaction has unwound.

##### Pointer Target Ownership

A pointer holder owns the holder and association variable, not its target.
Default scalar-derived pointer target ownership is native: holder destruction
nullifies the component and deallocates only the holder. It must never
deallocate an unowned target. When final association matches a known module,
parent, or wrapper-owned target, retain that owner in completed policy; an
otherwise durable native target retains the originating extension and remains
the native program's release responsibility. Native code that returns a pointer
to an expired local target violates the contract rather than creating an x2py
fallback.

This completed owner/release rule removes the old wrapper-owned pointer-result
blocker. Reassociation is supported, but it never silently transfers target
ownership to Python. Public documentation must warn that a native pointer saved
through a wrapper-owned target remains valid only while the wrapper and target
allocation remain alive.

##### Multiple Scalar-Derived Arguments

Do not generate `2**N` native call branches. Build one call context with one
slot per native argument and an ordered acquisition program:

1. validate every Python wrapper, exact qualified type, storage capability,
   allocation/association precondition, optional presence, and pointer-target
   owner before entering any native origin operation;
2. retain all Python/module owners and acquire module transaction guards in a
   deterministic total order;
3. deduplicate repeated actual identities so one module allocation or pointer
   is checked out once and its holder/address can feed multiple native slots;
4. move out module allocatables in deterministic order, rolling back already
   moved values in reverse order if a later acquisition fails;
5. initialize module pointer transaction holders;
6. enter all `SCOPED_REFERENCE` producers as a nested continuation chain,
   storing each address in the context; and
7. invoke the native procedure exactly once after every slot is ready, then
   unwind scoped producers, pointer restorations, allocation restorations,
   guards, and retained owners in reverse order.

If the same actual appears in multiple slots and any corresponding dummy may
define it while another slot references or defines it, reject the call before
checkout unless completed `INTENT` facts prove the aliasing legal. Read-only
duplicates share one acquisition. Never move the same module allocatable twice
or restore the same module pointer through independent locals.

The generic scoped-address consumer ABI remains
`consumer(object_address, context) -> status`. The context carries all earlier
addresses, holders, ordinary arguments, result slots, and the first error. A
consumer never retains `object_address`; multiple module variables are handled
by nesting producers, not by generating one origin-module cross product per
native procedure.

##### Error And Cleanup Contract

Use one status protocol across scoped consumers and module transaction
operations. Do not raise a Python exception, `longjmp`, or unwind C++ through a
Fortran frame. Record status and any Python exception data in the call context,
return normally through every producer, complete cleanup, and only then raise
in the binding.

- wrong qualified wrapper type, an incompatible matrix cell, or a known
  reassociable pointer dummy receiving nonpointer storage raises `TypeError`
  before native entry;
- a required ordinary/target/value/pointer-input actual whose allocatable is
  unallocated or pointer is disassociated raises `ValueError` before native
  entry;
- `A`, `AT`, and `P` descriptor calls preserve valid unallocated or
  disassociated state and do not reinterpret it as optional omission;
- only an omitted Python argument or explicit `None` for an optional contract
  selects native absence; a present empty handle never becomes omitted by
  accident;
- an active recursive/concurrent transaction raises `RuntimeError` before the
  affected origin changes state;
- every successful move-out has exactly one attempted move-back on every
  normally returning path, and every native module-pointer call has exactly one
  attempted association restore;
- cleanup continues in reverse order after the first restoration failure so
  independent origins are not stranded; the first failure is reported with
  later cleanup failures attached as context;
- a failed restoration leaves its origin guard poisoned instead of advertising
  a usable proxy, and raises `RuntimeError` after all other cleanup attempts;
- conversion, result allocation, and Python-object creation that can fail are
  completed before checkout where possible; failures after native return still
  restore every transaction before propagating; and
- process termination, `ERROR STOP`, signals, or invalid native pointers are
  not recoverable wrapper exceptions. The documentation must state that this
  cleanup guarantee covers paths that return through the generated ABI.

The per-origin guard must be thread-safe, or the binding must prove that the
GIL remains held for the complete transaction and that no callback re-entry is
possible. An unsynchronized Fortran `logical` is not a sufficient concurrency
guard. Internal synchronous address consumers are Phase 8 bridge machinery;
they do not expose the public callback semantics deferred to Phase 10.

##### Implementation And Proof Checklist

- [x] Preserve actual declaration attributes, module/non-module origin,
  `TARGET` lifetime, allocatable/pointer state, exact type identity, and
  pointer-dummy `INTENT` authority through parsing, semantic IR, and edited or
  generated `.pyi` round trips.
- [x] Replace the former category/action-only contract with completed facets
  capable of representing all six dummy forms and every action in the matrix.
  `DerivedDummyCategory` remains the completed declared-form label and
  `DerivedCallAction` remains the completed selected-action label; neither is
  allowed to stand in for the lifetime, access, failure, cleanup, target-owner,
  or release facets. The complete record includes `ALLOCATABLE,TARGET`, typed
  value, target lifetime, pointer-input
  validation, transaction cleanup, and target owner/release. Remove
  `RUNTIME_POINTER_TARGET`, the module-allocatable incompatibility, and all old
  fallback/rejection actions they made obsolete.
- [x] Complete every matrix decision in post-IR policy before `ir2ast.py`.
  Binding and bridge generation only dispatch named actions; neither backend
  inspects datatype, `intent`, module shape, address presence, or allocation
  state to select a different mechanism.
- [x] Generate one shared allocatable holder and pointer holder per qualified
  native type, with persistent create/destroy helpers and bridge-local
  transaction use. Prove source/generated-`.pyi` bundles import the identical
  holder definition and reject ABI/type mismatch before reconstruction.
- [x] Generate scoped-address producer operations for plain module objects and
  non-`TARGET` allocated module allocatables, direct address operations for
  durable module targets, move-out/move-back holder-address operations for
  module allocatables, and current-target/restore holder-address operations for
  module pointers.
- [x] Implement the ordered multi-argument acquisition/unwind program,
  deduplicated origin identity, legal read-only aliasing, reverse rollback,
  poisoned restoration failures, and a single final native invocation.
- [x] Implement the exact Python error mapping and optional/empty-state rules
  above. Add injected failures before first acquisition, after one of several
  acquisitions, during scoped nesting, after native return, and during each
  cleanup category.
- [x] Remove the interoperable-`bind(C)` restriction from typed derived
  `VALUE` calls. The Fortran bridge must perform the exact typed call without a
  C aggregate cast, byte copy, layout promise, or detached-object fallback.
- [x] Support wrapper-owned pointer results with a persistent pointer holder,
  native target ownership by default, explicit known-owner retention, direct
  association writeback, and holder-only destruction. Remove the old blanket
  target-ownership blocker rather than retaining it as a compatibility path.
- [x] Update public and maintainer documentation to teach the five actual
  declarations, six dummy forms, complete matrix, direct versus scoped
  address acquisition, holder and module transactions, `INTENT(IN)` pointer
  exception, target lifetime, native pointer-target ownership, multi-argument
  nesting, errors, and cleanup. Examples must show more than one scalar-derived
  argument and link back to one canonical explanation instead of repeating
  incomplete fragments.
- [x] Add one comprehensive native fixture at
  `tests/data/fortran/wrapper/fscalar_derived_actual_dummy_matrix_f90.f90`, its
  reduced source/generated contract under
  `tests/wrapper/fortran/derived_types/contracts/fscalar_derived_actual_dummy_matrix_phase8/`,
  focused policy/plan/artifact tests in
  `tests/wrapper_codegen/test_phase8_scalar_derived_actual_dummy_matrix.py`, and
  compiled tests in
  `tests/wrapper/fortran/derived_types/test_scalar_derived_actual_dummy_matrix.py`.
  Replace the earlier proposed separate module-allocatable and
  module-target/pointer fixtures; do not retain tests that assert their old
  rejection paths.
- [x] Make that native fixture a complete Fortran module containing all five
  module actual declarations, wrapper-owned ordinary/allocatable/pointer
  producers, all six dummy forms, both pointer `INTENT(IN)` and reassociable
  pointer procedures, two qualified native types with the same short name,
  optional arguments, injected operation failures, and state-reset helpers.
- [x] Parameterize policy/plan tests over every matrix cell. Every legal cell
  must select its one completed action; every incompatible cell must assert its
  exact pre-native `TypeError`; allocated/unallocated and
  associated/disassociated states must assert their exact `ValueError`, valid
  descriptor call, or optional-absence behavior.
- [x] Compiled tests must exercise mixed calls containing several
  scalar-derived arguments. Include at least: multiple nested scoped module
  objects; two module allocatable transactions plus a module pointer
  transaction; mixed direct, holder, scoped, allocatable, pointer, target, and
  value slots in one native call; repeated read-only actual identity; rejected
  writable duplicate identity; failure after the first of several checkouts;
  reverse restoration; native deallocation/reallocation; pointer
  nullification/reassociation/allocation/deallocation; and owner retention.
  Phase 8 cannot close if the new compiled procedures test only one derived
  argument at a time.
- [x] Run the portable ABI fixture with the supported GNU toolchain and every
  available secondary compiler in the development environment. The proof must
  cover scoped `C_FUNPTR` consumers, `C_PTR` transaction holders,
  `C_F_PROCPOINTER`, holder targetability, target-preserving `MOVE_ALLOC`, and
  the accepted-`INTENT(IN)`/rejected-reassociable pointer distinction.

### Phase 8I — Production Routing, Regression, And Completion

- [x] Add separate support-report lanes for derived inputs, optional derived
  inputs, in-place derived arguments, wrapper-owned derived results, plain
  module proxies, `Aliased` borrowed module objects, borrowed field owners,
  and the exact typed-value slice.
- [x] Replace the isolated scalar-derived descriptor routes with one
  dependency-closed actual/dummy-matrix lane only after every unchecked Phase
  8H row passes. It must cover direct and scoped references, target adapters,
  allocatable and pointer holders, module allocation and association
  transactions, exact typed values, and multi-argument acquisition/unwind.
  No old call-incompatible, nonreassociating-only, or interoperability-only
  compatibility route may remain selectable.
- [x] Add one deliberate legacy/direct parity node for every dependency-closed
  Phase 8 lane and append it to the production rollout evidence only after its
  generated artifacts and runtime behavior match.
- [x] Update the migration matrix row for each reduced unit. Keep broad units
  containing constructors, methods, inheritance, or callbacks on
  their explicit Phase 9/10 blockers until whole-generation-unit support is
  complete.
- [x] Treat source and generated-`.pyi` default field constructors as Phase 9
  class-surface blockers. Do not select the Phase 8 route merely because the
  generated constructor was consumed into origin metadata rather than retained
  as a semantic method; reduced opaque Phase 8 contracts must explicitly
  suppress construction.
- [x] Prove an eligible opaque-derived generation unit selects the production
  wrapper-plan route and no longer invokes `semantic_ir_to_codegen_ast()`.
- [x] Keep direct plan edits meaningful across both backends and preserve the
  global no-fallback rule when a derived type, owner, release, or field action
  is incomplete.
- [x] In every relevant planner, validator, binding generator, and bridge
  generator, keep scalar, string, ordinary-array/native-handle, and
  derived-type lowering methods in consistent groups with one short comment
  above each group. Preserve typed object-kind/action matching; grouping must
  not introduce datatype inference or a second dispatcher.
- [x] Run focused parser/printer, ownership/policy/readiness, plan/validation,
  binding/bridge/printer, and runtime tests; relevant source/generated-`.pyi`
  wrapper parity; and regressions for scalar, string, array, and Phase 7 handle
  lanes.
- [x] Run the wrapper suite excluding the deferred LAPACK coverage, the wrapper
  codegen complexity checker, documentation checks, whitespace check, and the
  required static-analysis suite before closing implementation.
- [x] Run the comprehensive Phase 8 scalar-derived actual/dummy matrix policy,
  artifact, and multi-argument compiled tests; all retained holder and Phase
  7/8 regressions; the wrapper suite excluding LAPACK; documentation and
  whitespace checks; the wrapper complexity checker; and the required static
  suite after the replacement route is implemented.
- [x] Close Phase 8 only when every supported rank-zero non-polymorphic derived
  input/result/module transfer is direct, both plain module-proxy and `Aliased`
  address-backed module-object paths are direct, live member operations and
  recursive-edge policy are validated before emission, and
  every remaining class-surface/callback/derived-array case has an exact Phase
  9/10 or unsupported-policy blocker.

### Phase 8 Implementation Evidence

- Post-IR origin, identity, handoff, ownership, field, lifecycle, and exact
  blocker evidence lives in
  `tests/wrapper_codegen/test_phase8_derived_types.py`, with supporting parser,
  printer, source-conversion, ownership, and readiness suites named in
  `tests/wrapper/CHECKLIST_COVERAGE.md`.
- Public-field validation is split into named completed-policy, descriptor,
  typed object-kind, and setter checks so no single semantic-policy routine
  becomes a second backend-style dispatcher.
- Compiled legacy/source and direct-plan evidence lives in
  `tests/wrapper/fortran/derived_types/test_phase8_derived_plan.py`. It covers
  required, optional, in-place, caller-supplied output, ordinary and `bind(C)`
  typed native `value`, direct/hidden owned result, module-proxy,
  direct-address module object, constant value, field, owner-retention,
  allocation/cleanup artifact, and exactly-once finalization behavior.
- The former isolated scalar-derived descriptor evidence in
  `tests/wrapper_codegen/test_phase8_scalar_derived_descriptors.py`,
  `tests/wrapper/fortran/derived_types/test_scalar_derived_descriptor_plan.py`,
  and `tests/data/fortran/wrapper/fscalar_derived_descriptors_f90.f90` is
  superseded by the comprehensive policy/artifact and compiled matrix files
  named in Phase 8H. They cover all 60 declaration/dummy cells, empty states,
  qualified same-short-name identities, `sequence` typed values, holder and
  module transactions, multi-origin unwind, pointer target ownership, injected
  cleanup failures, and the exact retained incompatibilities. No obsolete
  module-allocatable rejection, stable-pointer-only, or wrapper-pointer-result
  blocker remains as negative compatibility coverage.
- `x2py/pipeline/build.py` registers the dependency-closed Phase 8 support
  lanes and their passing production evidence. The automatic-route test
  replaces `semantic_ir_to_codegen_ast()` with a failure sentinel and proves an
  eligible opaque-derived unit never invokes it.
- Constructors, methods, properties beyond the completed field descriptors,
  inheritance, and polymorphic class orchestration remain Phase 9. Public
  callbacks remain Phase 10. Arrays of derived values, non-scalar holder member
  operations, recursive value edges without completed descriptor policy,
  unresolved imported types without an exact runtime definition, immutable visible
  derived replacement, and mixed native result plus visible-writeback envelopes
  carry exact unsupported-policy blockers instead of selecting a fallback.
  Internal synchronous scoped-address consumers and module transactions are
  Phase 8 implementation machinery, not deferred public callbacks.

Historical Phase 8 closure evidence before the module-allocatable and
module-pointer restore redesigns (2026-07-15): all 39 focused Phase 8
plan/compiled tests, the 711-test
cross-stage regression batch, all 79 runtime-handle tests, 1,133 documentation
and layout tests, and all 329 wrapper tests outside the deferred full
BLAS/LAPACK file passed. The wrapper complexity checker, Ruff lint/format,
Bandit, Vulture, whitespace, and explicit-`origin/main` Radon policy passed;
the advisory full Radon complexity and maintainability reports were also
produced. The required `--base-ref auto` Radon invocation could not resolve
CI-only base-SHA variables locally, and the explicit-base rerun passed. No
LAPACK test was run locally. This evidence does not close the reopened Phase 8H
rows.

Final Phase 8H/I closure evidence (2026-07-15): the focused Phase 8 plus route-
ledger batch passed 180 tests; the affected cross-stage semantic, lowering,
runtime-handle, planner, and backend batch passed 611 tests; and the complete
wrapper suite outside the deferred combined BLAS/LAPACK file passed 445 tests.
Documentation checks passed 1,123 tests and whitespace validation passed. The
GNU toolchain compiled and ran the complete matrix suite; Intel `ifx` 2026.1.0
compiled, linked, and ran the same generated ABI for `sequence` typed values,
mixed six-form input, module allocatable/pointer transactions, target-preserving
`MOVE_ALLOC`, and the accepted-input/rejected-reassociable pointer distinction.
The wrapper complexity checker, Ruff lint/format, Bandit, Vulture, explicit-
`origin/main` Radon policy, and advisory Radon complexity/maintainability runs
passed. The CI-only `--base-ref auto` Radon lookup was unavailable locally, so
the required explicit-base rerun was used. No LAPACK test was run locally.

### Phase 8 Expansion Gate

- [x] Inventory the live semantic contract, post-IR ownership policy, active
  snapshot paths to remove, legacy binding/bridge paths, plan-route blockers,
  public docs, checked `.pyi` fixtures, and real wrapper tests.
- [x] Separate origin, owned/borrowed lifetime, module address acquisition,
  input/result/field/module-state use, destruction, owner retention, and
  recursive member-path access into dependency-ordered Phase 8A-I sub-lanes.
- [x] Record the strict Phase 8/9/10 boundaries and identify reduced existing
  native units that can prove opaque transfers without first migrating public
  constructors, methods, inheritance, or callbacks. Public field descriptors
  are part of Phase 8.
- [x] Begin Phase 8 implementation only from Phase 8A and keep every later
  sub-lane blocked on its declared dependencies.

## Phase 9 — Classes, Constructors, And Methods

Expansion status: complete. Implementation status: complete. The direct class
path is covered by policy, plan-edit, artifact, compiled runtime, production
routing, and broad non-LAPACK wrapper-suite evidence below.

Scope: generated Python class objects, namespace registration, default and
keyword constructors, explicit constructor bindings, constructor overloads,
instance and static methods, type-bound dispatch, method overloads, finalizer
attachment, inheritance, and the first supported scalar polymorphic input
dispatch. Phase 9 assembles those public class surfaces on the opaque storage,
field descriptors, handoffs, and lifetime rules completed in Phase 8.

### Phase 9 Boundary And Explicit Non-Scope

Phase 9 may compose completed Phase 8 records but must not revisit them.
Constructor and method policy may select how an instance is created or passed;
it may not change object origin, storage kind, field access, owner retention,
release, nullability, native setter assignment, or destruction. A class plan
references the namespace-owned `DerivedTypePlan` and its field plans rather
than copying or rendering them.

The following surfaces are in Phase 9:

- one generated Python type object for each public supported semantic class,
  with stable native identity and explicit Python base identity;
- an explicitly present or deliberately absent public constructor surface;
- generated default/keyword field initialization for eligible public scalar
  fields, including omitted-keyword preservation of native defaults;
- direct `@bind("native_name")` constructors and explicit constructor overload
  candidates linked to concrete native procedures;
- passed-object type-bound instance methods, non-type-bound methods attached to
  the class by the semantic contract, and supported `@staticmethod` methods;
- class-owned overload sets with exact candidate signatures and deterministic
  runtime selection;
- owned-instance finalization through the Phase 8 destroy/release path and
  borrowed-instance non-destruction;
- Python inheritance for supported Fortran extension types; and
- scalar, input-only polymorphic calls whose accepted runtime class set and
  concrete native dispatch targets are fully enumerated before lowering.

The following remain outside Phase 9:

- callbacks, adapters, trampolines, and callable lifetime; these remain Phase
  10 even when a callback argument/result is a derived object;
- module-level generic/operator migration units that do not require a class
  surface; those remain in Phase 11, although they may reuse the same overload
  candidate and runtime-match vocabulary;
- arrays of derived or polymorphic values, elemental class dispatch, and
  partial construction/destruction of array elements;
- polymorphic results, mutable polymorphic dummies, allocatable/pointer
  polymorphic scalars, unlimited polymorphism, abstract instantiation,
  deferred-binding execution, and runtime extension types not enumerated in
  the semantic module;
- any unresolved Phase 8 storage blocker merely because a constructor or
  method happens to use that type; Phase 9 reuses the completed allocatable and
  pointer holders and must not invent a second storage path;
- generic constructor selection whose candidates are indistinguishable at the
  Python boundary; and
- compatibility aliases, synthesized legacy entrypoints, string-built backend
  method names, or a fallback from an incomplete class plan to legacy class
  lowering.

### Phase 9 Existing Oracle And Inventory

The legacy route plus existing source/generated-`.pyi` runtime assertions are
the behavioral oracle. Capture complete binding, bridge, header, and runtime
evidence before each reduced direct-plan slice. Correct unsafe behavior only
when the documented contract says so; do not preserve legacy architecture.

| Existing unit | Phase 9 behavior to preserve | Required reduced slice |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `derived_types/test_constructors_and_finalizers.py::test_fortran_default_constructor_keywords_and_finalization[*]` | default construction, keyword-only scalar fields, native defaults, invalid-call cleanup, and exactly-once finalization | default/keyword constructor plus owned destroy path |
| `derived_types/test_derived_type_methods.py::test_modern_fortran_derived_type_exposes_class_and_type_bound_methods[*]` | instance methods, explicit binding names, scalar arguments/results, class static factory, and Phase 7 handle fields | split `vector` methods from `vector_store` handle methods and static factory |
| `derived_types/test_borrowed_finalizers.py::test_borrowed_child_wrapper_never_finalizes_native_component[*]` | borrowed child retains parent; only the owned parent finalizes | class assembly over the completed Phase 8 borrowed-field owner path |
| `derived_types/test_derived_layout.py::test_bind_c_derived_types_use_accessors_and_fortran_value_copy[*]` | default class creation and methods coexist with opaque field access and typed native value copy | class surface only; Phase 8 retains layout and handoff ownership |
| `derived_types/test_inheritance.py::test_fortran_extension_types_generate_python_inheritance[*]` | Python subclass relationships, inherited field/method access, overridden methods, unbound base calls, and scalar polymorphic input dispatch | base/extension class graph first, polymorphic call second |
| `tests/semantics/conversion/pyi/test_classes_and_overloads.py` | generated versus bound constructors, removed constructors, direct constructor targets, explicit overload links, type-bound root targets, and invalid metadata diagnostics | semantic-policy fixtures before planner/backend work |
| `edit_pyi_contracts/test_surface_edit_contracts.py` | edited contracts can remove constructors/methods/candidates and add explicit bindings without resurrecting source declarations | absence/export validation and source/generated/edited parity |
| `naming/test_defined_operators.py` and `naming/test_generic_interfaces.py` | exact candidate matching and Python export naming | reuse candidate-match vocabulary; broad module/generic units remain Phase 11 |

Inventory these legacy owners without importing them into the direct package:

- `x2py/semantics/ir2ast.py` currently interprets constructor overloads,
  passed-object positions, type-bound names, polymorphic variants, and class
  insertion. Each semantic decision found there must move into post-IR class
  policy before direct lowering.
- `x2py/codegen/bindings/c_to_python.py` currently assembles type objects,
  constructors, methods, overloads, properties, inheritance, module exports,
  and finalizers. Reuse emitted behavior as the oracle, not its broad control
  flow or method-name synthesis.
- `x2py/codegen/bridges/fortran_to_c.py` currently supplies typed constructor
  allocation, passed-object association, method calls, overload interfaces,
  and finalization helpers. Direct bridge generation must consume completed
  class/method actions and reuse Phase 8 native storage helpers.
- Generated semantic `.pyi` class declarations are a public contract. A
  consumed default constructor still counts as a constructor surface and must
  remain a whole-unit Phase 9 route requirement.

### Phase 9 Plan Shape And Action Vocabulary

Extend the existing namespace plan; do not introduce a rendered-class layer or
a second function plan.

- Add one namespace-owned `ClassSurfacePlan` (name illustrative, not
  prescriptive) that references exactly one `DerivedTypePlan`, its Python
  exports, optional base-class identity, constructor plan, ordered methods,
  ordered overload sets, type-object slots, and module-registration action.
- Add a `ConstructorPlan` with an explicit kind: `ABSENT`,
  `DEFAULT_FIELDS`, `BOUND_PROCEDURE`, or `OVERLOAD_SET`. Record allocation
  action, accepted Python parameters, native target/call slots, initialized
  fields, omitted-field behavior, cleanup action, and success transition.
- Reuse `FunctionPlan` for each concrete method or constructor target. Add only
  a class-call facet recording method kind, passed-object position, self
  storage requirement, result attachment, public descriptor flags, and the
  owning class identity.
- Add an `OverloadSetPlan` containing public export, overload kind, ordered
  concrete candidate references, typed runtime predicates, ambiguity result,
  no-match diagnostic, and selected native target. Candidate predicates use
  exact dtype/rank/derived-class facts already completed by argument plans.
- Add an `InheritancePlan` containing canonical base identity, storage
  compatibility, inherited/overridden method ownership, Python base type
  symbol, and module initialization dependency order.
- Add a `PolymorphicDispatchPlan` only for supported scalar input calls. It
  enumerates accepted concrete class identities and a concrete `FunctionPlan`
  variant for each; it must not rediscover subclasses from runtime object names.
- Keep destructor selection on the referenced Phase 8 derived handoff/release
  plan. Phase 9 records only which class slot invokes that existing action and
  which constructor failure edges need cleanup.

Stable semantic action names must describe behavior, not backend function
names. At minimum distinguish:

- class registration: `CREATE_TYPE`, `SET_BASE`, `READY_TYPE`, `EXPORT_TYPE`;
- construction: `OMIT`, `ALLOCATE_DEFAULT`, `ALLOCATE_AND_ASSIGN_FIELDS`,
  `CALL_BOUND_CONSTRUCTOR`, `DISPATCH_CONSTRUCTOR`, `REJECT_CONSTRUCTION`;
- method binding: `INSTANCE`, `STATIC`, and explicit unsupported class-method
  policy until a real class-method contract exists;
- passed-object handoff: `WRAPPER_ADDRESS`, `BORROWED_ADDRESS`, or the exact
  completed Phase 8 storage action;
- overload selection: `MATCH_EXACT`, `SELECT_CANDIDATE`, `NO_MATCH`,
  `AMBIGUOUS`; and
- construction lifecycle: `ALLOCATE`, `INITIALIZE`, `COMMIT_OWNER`,
  `CLEANUP_UNCOMMITTED`, `DESTROY_OWNED`.

### Mandatory Phase 9 Migration Algorithm

For every dependency-closed sub-lane:

1. Capture one passing source/generated-`.pyi` legacy unit and its complete
   class, binding, bridge, header, and runtime assertions.
2. Complete class export, constructor kind, method kind, passed-object policy,
   overload candidates, inheritance, polymorphic accepted set, allocation,
   commit, cleanup, and destruction before `ir2ast.py`.
3. Project those facts into the existing namespace, derived-type, function,
   lifecycle, and native-slot plans plus the smallest class-specific facets.
4. Validate the complete class graph and every cross-backend symbolic role
   before either backend emits source.
5. Lower through small named methods selected only by typed actions. Backend
   local temporaries may implement a selected action but cannot choose policy.
6. Compare generated artifacts with the oracle and record intentional
   differences before compiling.
7. Add focused policy, plan-edit, validation, printer, binding, bridge,
   source/generated-`.pyi`, edited-contract, and compiled runtime tests.
8. Promote production routing only after the reduced unit passes direct-plan
   runtime parity and no class-surface fallback remains.

### Phase 9A — Semantic Class-Surface Completion

- [x] Add completed post-IR policy records for public class identity, exports,
  constructor kind, method kind, passed-object position, overload ownership,
  base identity, type-object registration, and construction permissions.
- [x] Preserve explicit absence: an edited `.pyi` that removes `__init__`, a
  method, or an overload candidate must produce an absent plan entry and cannot
  resurrect source behavior.
- [x] Move any class-surface inference still in `ir2ast.py` into policy
  completion. Readiness must report the owner path and exact missing decision.
- [x] Add policy tests for generated, bound, removed, overloaded, inherited,
  abstract, and invalid class surfaces before planner changes.

### Phase 9B — Typed Class Plan And Validation

- [x] Add the namespace-owned class, constructor, method-call, overload, and
  inheritance plan facets described above, each referencing existing Phase 8
  type/field/lifetime plans rather than copying them.
- [x] Project Python/native names and export aliases once. Do not synthesize
  backend method names from strings or recover native targets by scanning
  emitted functions.
- [x] Validate unique class/type identity, base-before-derived order, one
  constructor kind, method ownership, passed-object position, native call-slot
  agreement, field-plan identity, lifecycle roles, and module export symbols.
- [x] Add direct plan-edit tests proving invalid constructor, method, base,
  overload, or lifecycle references fail before emission in both backends.

### Phase 9C — Class Creation And Module Registration

- [x] Emit one Python type object per supported class, attach the completed
  Phase 8 field descriptors, set the validated base type, ready the type, and
  export every completed Python name in dependency order.
- [x] Keep opaque instance storage identical to Phase 8 wrapper storage. Class
  assembly must not add C aggregate layout, component offsets, or a second
  native owner field.
- [x] Attach the Phase 8 destruction action only to owning classes; borrowed
  proxies and nested objects retain owners and never gain independent destroy
  slots.
- [x] Add artifact and compiled reduced tests for an opaque constructible class,
  an intentionally nonconstructible class, a borrowed child, and exact module
  export identity.

### Phase 9D — Default And Keyword Field Constructors

- [x] Build constructor parameters only from fields explicitly eligible in
  completed constructor policy. Preserve keyword-only behavior and native
  default component initialization for omitted fields.
- [x] Allocate the Phase 8 persistent native instance first, apply validated
  field assignments through existing field setter actions, then commit wrapper
  ownership only after every step succeeds.
- [x] On parse, conversion, allocation, or field-assignment failure, clean up
  the uncommitted native instance exactly once. Failed `tp_init` must not leak,
  double-finalize, or expose a partially initialized wrapper.
- [x] Replay `fconstructors_f90` for default, partial, complete, positional,
  unknown-keyword, native-default, and finalization-count assertions through
  both source and generated-`.pyi` contracts.

### Phase 9E — Explicit And Overloaded Constructors

- [x] Represent direct `@bind("native_name")` construction as one constructor
  action linked to a concrete function plan. It replaces, rather than wraps or
  falls back to, the generated field constructor.
- [x] Represent constructor overloads as an explicit constructor-owned overload
  set. Do not combine `@overload` and `@native_call`, and do not reinterpret a
  normal method overload as `tp_init`.
- [x] Complete allocation-before-call versus native-produced-instance policy,
  result attachment, owner commit, failure cleanup, and exactly-once release for
  every candidate before lowering.
- [x] Reject indistinguishable candidates, missing targets, incompatible self
  types, mixed constructor kinds, or ambiguous edited declarations during
  policy/readiness or plan validation, never from candidate trial calls.
- [x] Add isolated semantic and compiled fixtures for direct bound construction,
  two distinguishable constructor candidates, no-match, ambiguity, target
  failure cleanup, and source/generated/edited-contract parity.

### Phase 9F — Instance And Static Methods

- [x] Lower passed-object instance methods from the completed self position and
  Phase 8 handoff. Preserve native argument order when `self` is not the first
  native slot.
- [x] Support explicit binding names and type-bound root-target metadata without
  exporting the private concrete target as a duplicate module function.
- [x] Lower supported static methods without fabricating `self`; attach them to
  the type object with their completed export and descriptor flags.
- [x] Reuse ordinary function argument/result plans for scalar, string, array,
  handle, and derived transfers. A method cannot widen an unsupported ordinary
  call lane.
- [x] Replay reduced `fclasses_f90` vector methods first, then `vector_store`
  handle methods and static factory, with exact source/generated-`.pyi` runtime
  and artifact parity.

### Phase 9G — Class-Owned Overload Dispatch

- [x] Complete ordered candidates and exact runtime predicates for each
  class-owned overload set. Candidate selection may inspect only typed Python
  argument facts named by the plan, never invoke candidates speculatively.
- [x] Reuse one overload matching vocabulary for constructors, methods,
  operators, and later Phase 11 module generics while keeping their owners and
  call actions distinct.
- [x] Detect indistinguishable signatures before emission and produce stable
  no-match diagnostics listing the public overload and accepted signatures.
- [x] Validate native target, Python export, argument/result plans, passed-object
  position, and overload kind across binding and bridge views.
- [x] Add focused method-overload tests for primitive kinds, ranks, derived
  subclasses, keyword normalization, exact no-match, and ambiguity; keep broad
  defined-operator/module-generic promotion in Phase 11.

### Phase 9H — Finalization And Constructor Failure Safety

- [x] Route normal owned-instance deallocation, constructor failure, and
  native-constructor failure through the same Phase 8 destroy/release action,
  guarded by an explicit uncommitted/committed lifecycle state.
- [x] Prove finalization occurs exactly once for successfully constructed
  owners, once for native storage allocated before a rejected constructor call,
  and never for borrowed children or native-owned module objects.
- [x] Prove child-to-parent retention survives method/property access and that
  deleting the parent first delays only the parent's owning finalizer.
- [x] Replay `fconstructors_f90` and `fborrowed_finalizer_f90`, including forced
  Python argument failures and repeated garbage collection.

### Phase 9I — Inheritance And Scalar Polymorphic Input Dispatch

- [x] Complete canonical base/extension relationships, storage compatibility,
  inherited fields, inherited methods, overrides, Python base symbols, and
  module initialization order before planning.
- [x] Construct base and derived wrappers with the same Phase 8 opaque storage
  contract while preserving exact runtime type identity and safe unbound base
  method calls on derived instances.
- [x] For each supported scalar input-only polymorphic dummy, enumerate the
  accepted concrete class identities and one concrete native call variant per
  identity. Reject unknown or abstract runtime classes before the native call.
- [x] Keep polymorphic results, mutable dummies, arrays, descriptor-backed
  polymorphic scalars, unlimited polymorphism, and unenumerated extensions on
  exact blockers; inheritance must not silently widen them.
- [x] Replay `finheritance_f90` for `issubclass`, `isinstance`, inherited field
  access, override dispatch, unbound base calls, and base/circle/box
  polymorphic inputs through source and generated-`.pyi` routes.

### Phase 9J — Production Routing, Documentation, And Closure

- [x] Add support-report lanes for class registration, default constructors,
  bound constructors, constructor overloads, instance methods, static methods,
  class overloads, finalizers, inheritance, and scalar polymorphic input.
- [x] Add one reduced compiled direct-plan node per dependency-closed lane, then
  update its migration-matrix row only after artifact and runtime parity.
- [x] Prove eligible class units select the production wrapper-plan route and
  never call `semantic_ir_to_codegen_ast()`; an unsupported class decision must
  keep the whole generation unit on one exact blocker without partial fallback.
- [x] Synchronize constructor/method/inheritance user docs, semantic `.pyi`
  reference, source map, feature matrix, subject README, and checklist coverage
  with the implemented class contract.
- [x] Run focused policy/plan/backend tests, all affected existing class wrapper
  nodes through source/generated-`.pyi` modes, the wrapper suite excluding
  LAPACK, the wrapper complexity checker, documentation checks, whitespace,
  and the required static-analysis suite.
- [x] Close Phase 9 only when every supported constructor/method/inheritance
  unit routes directly, all Phase 8 field/storage/lifecycle decisions remain
  unchanged, and every remaining callback, derived-array, polymorphic, or
  ambiguous-overload case has an exact Phase 10/11 or unsupported-policy
  blocker.

Closure evidence (2026-07-16): focused semantic, lowering, routing, and direct
Phase 8-10 plan tests passed 184 tests after the final policy refactor. The
complete local wrapper suite excluding LAPACK passed 449 tests in source and
generated-contract modes. The wrapper complexity checker, Ruff lint/format,
Bandit, Vulture, explicit-`origin/main` Radon policy, and advisory Radon
complexity/maintainability commands passed. The CI-only `--base-ref auto`
Radon lookup could not resolve outside CI, so the required explicit-base run
was used. No LAPACK test was run locally.

### Phase 9 Expansion Gate

- [x] Inventory class creation/destruction, constructor categories,
  instance/static/type-bound methods, overloads, inheritance/polymorphism,
  decorator effects, module initialization, legacy owners, semantic fixtures,
  and passing runtime oracles.
- [x] Define the Phase 8/9/10/11 ownership boundaries and keep all class
  implementation rows unchecked.
- [x] Split implementation into dependency-ordered Phase 9A-J sub-lanes with
  explicit policy, plan, validation, lowering, artifact, compiled parity,
  production routing, documentation, and closure gates.

## Phase 10 — Callbacks And Trampolines

Expansion status: complete. Implementation status: complete. Immediate
callbacks are covered by focused policy/plan/artifact tests, existing compiled
runtime oracles, production routing, and broad non-LAPACK wrapper-suite
evidence below.

Scope: immediate callback argument validation, call-scoped context lifetime,
external Fortran adapter procedures, C trampolines, scalar/string/array/derived
argument and result conversion, permissive reference writeback, same-thread
re-entry and GIL handling, callback cleanup, and the documented fatal error
boundary.

### Phase 10 Boundary And Explicit Non-Scope

Phase 10 composes ordinary call transfers completed in Phases 2-9 but does not
reinterpret them. A callback signature is transport-facing: it describes the
procedure ABI that native Fortran calls, including argument order,
value/reference transport, rank, shape, character length, and result
representation. It deliberately does not repeat native callback `intent`.
Normal wrapper projection and callback adapter projection remain distinct
completed records.

Named `@prototype` declarations are the single callback-signature authority.
Callback arguments reference a prototype by name; bare prototype arguments use
reference transport and permissive writable Python storage, while `Value(T)`
is the only transport override. Prototypes are semantic-only declarations and
never become Python runtime exports. Post-IR policy selects either an implicit
external adapter declaration or a named explicit declaration from completed
prototype characteristics. Lowering does not reconstruct that decision or
duplicate native `intent`.

The supported callback contract is deliberately call-scoped:

- the Python callable is validated and retained before the native call, placed
  in one thread-local context stack for that callback site, and released after
  the native call returns;
- nested callback-taking calls on the same entering Python thread are allowed;
- each C trampoline validates the entering thread, acquires the GIL, converts
  completed adapter arguments, invokes the current Python callable, converts
  or copies back results, releases the GIL, and returns to its Fortran adapter;
- `Value(T)` uses value conversion; scalar reference storage, fixed-length
  character storage, arrays, and derived objects use permissive copy-in/out
  storage already asserted by the runtime tests; and
- a Python exception, invalid callback return, missing context, or cross-thread
  invocation prints the Python error and aborts the host process. The direct
  path must not fabricate a fallback result or continue native execution.

The following remain outside Phase 10:

- stored callbacks, callback registration/unregistration, procedure-pointer
  fields, callbacks invoked after the wrapped call, optional dummy procedures,
  null procedure pointers, asynchronous callbacks, and cross-thread callback
  execution;
- persistent callable ownership, callback teardown during object/library
  destruction, and callback use as a synchronization mechanism;
- callbacks whose signature is incomplete, assumed-rank, has a runtime-only
  character length, or otherwise lacks the exact ABI facts required by the
  adapter and trampoline;
- callback-specific coercion, recovery, exception-result, or argument
  reordering policies not present in the public contract or legacy tests; and
- module generic/operator orchestration that merely contains a callback-taking
  candidate; its callback transfer may be reusable, but public generic routing
  remains Phase 11.

### Phase 10 Existing Oracle And Inventory

The public callback guide/reference, generated semantic `.pyi` contracts, and
existing source/generated-`.pyi` runtime assertions are the behavioral oracle.

| Existing unit | Phase 10 behavior to preserve | Required reduced slice |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `callbacks/test_scalar_callbacks.py::test_immediate_scalar_dummy_procedure_calls_python_callback[*]` | scalar result/void callbacks, callable validation, balanced references, nested same-thread re-entry, held-GIL wrapper envelope, and thread-local context | first context, trampoline, scalar-value, and cleanup slice |
| `callbacks/test_scalar_callbacks.py::test_callback_exception_prints_traceback_and_aborts_host_process[*]` | callback exception, wrong result, and wrong signature print a Python error and terminate the subprocess | fatal-boundary slice after scalar success |
| `callbacks/test_array_callbacks.py::test_immediate_dummy_procedure_converts_array_arguments_and_results[*]` | writable array view, shaped array result, outer-output identity, and reference writeback | array argument/result slice |
| `callbacks/test_all_callback_shapes.py::test_immediate_callbacks_cover_all_supported_argument_shapes[*]` | scalar values, fixed strings, arrays, derived values, non-scalar reference writeback, and one combined call envelope | cross-kind closure slice |
| `callbacks/test_derived_callbacks.py::test_immediate_dummy_procedure_converts_derived_arguments_and_results[*]` | callback-local borrowed derived input plus wrapper-owned derived result conversion | derived slice after Phase 9 construction |
| `callbacks/test_callback_generated_pyi_contracts.py` | named prototypes, reference-default and `Value(T)` transport, shape, character storage, cross-module identity, and result annotations round-trip exactly | semantic-contract parity slice |
| `semantics/conversion/pyi/test_types_and_values.py` callback cases | prototype declarations and references, `Value(T)`, exact argument names used by shapes, and unnecessary `Addr(...)` prototype forms | policy completion before planner work |

### Phase 10 Plan Shape And Action Vocabulary

Extend the existing argument/function plans; do not add a second function plan
or embed a legacy AST.

- Add one `CallbackHandoffPlan` facet to each callable argument. It records the
  callable owner, call-scoped lifetime, context symbol, context stack action,
  entering-thread rule, GIL rule, Fortran adapter symbol, C trampoline symbol,
  ordered callback argument plans, optional result plan, and fatal-error
  action.
- Add a `CallbackTransferPlan` for each callback argument/result containing the
  semantic type identity, object kind, value/reference ABI, rank/shape/length
  roles, Python barrier action, primitive-scalar value projection or non-scalar
  reference writeback, borrowed-owner retention, and exact C ABI roles.
- Reuse ordinary scalar, string, array, and derived plan vocabulary where the
  representation is identical. The native callback is the caller, so normal
  Python-to-native argument projection cannot be silently reused in reverse.
- Add ordered function lifecycle phases `VALIDATE_CALLBACK`, `PUSH_CONTEXT`,
  `ENTER_NATIVE`, `POP_CONTEXT`, and `RELEASE_CALLBACK`. Every failure edge
  before native entry unwinds acquired references; the fatal trampoline edge
  never returns.
- Keep backend-local adapter locals and temporary Python views inside the
  selected implementation method. They are emitted-code details, not semantic
  policy.

Stable actions must describe behavior, not generated function names. At
minimum distinguish:

- callable/context: `VALIDATE_CALLABLE`, `RETAIN_CALLABLE`, `PUSH_CONTEXT`,
  `POP_CONTEXT`, `RELEASE_CALLABLE`;
- callback ABI: `VALUE`, `REFERENCE`, `DATA_AND_SHAPE`,
  `DATA_AND_LENGTH`, and `DERIVED_ADDRESS`;
- adapter transfer: `COPY_IN`, `COPY_OUT`, `COPY_IN_OUT`, `BORROW_READ_ONLY`,
  and `BORROW_WRITABLE`;
- trampoline runtime: `REQUIRE_ENTERING_THREAD`, `ACQUIRE_GIL`, `CALL_PYTHON`,
  `RELEASE_GIL`, and `ABORT_WITH_PYTHON_ERROR`; and
- result handling: `RETURN_SCALAR`, `RETURN_ARRAY_ADDRESS`,
  `RETURN_DERIVED_ADDRESS`, `RETURN_VOID`, and `REJECT_RESULT`.

### Mandatory Phase 10 Migration Algorithm

For every dependency-closed sub-lane:

1. Capture the documented behavior, one passing source/generated-`.pyi`
   legacy unit, and its callback-related binding, bridge, adapter, trampoline,
   and runtime assertions.
2. Complete callable validity, signature order, ABI roles, reference
   writeback/value isolation,
   shape/length dependencies, result handling, context lifetime, thread/GIL
   rules, cleanup, and fatal behavior before wrapper planning.
3. Project those facts into the existing function/argument/lifecycle plans plus
   the smallest callback-specific facets.
4. Validate the binding, bridge, adapter, and trampoline role graph before
   either backend emits source.
5. Lower through typed action dispatch and small named methods. Do not trial a
   callback or infer shape/transport from emitted locals.
6. Compare emitted artifacts and behavior with the runtime oracle; document
   any safety improvement before changing observable behavior.
7. Add focused policy, editable-plan, validation, binding, bridge, printer,
   source/generated-`.pyi`, subprocess-failure, and compiled runtime tests.
8. Promote production routing only after the complete callback-taking
   generation unit passes direct-plan parity with no callback fallback.

### Phase 10A — Semantic Callback Completion

- [x] Add completed post-IR callback records for callable signature order,
  object kind, value/reference ABI, shape/length roles, result representation,
  call scope, context lifetime, same-thread rule, GIL rule, cleanup, and
  fatal-error behavior.
- [x] Preserve generated and edited named prototypes exactly. Reject an
  incomplete prototype reference, unnecessary `Addr`, optional procedure,
  stored/procedure-pointer lifetime, unavailable mandatory native interface,
  or unsupported result with the owner path and one exact reason.
- [x] Complete callback signature/result/ownership policy before wrapper
  planning; lowering may only project the completed callback record.
- [x] Add policy/readiness tests for reference-default transport, `Value(T)`,
  and retained unsupported forms before planner changes.

### Phase 10B — Typed Callback Plan And Validation

- [x] Add callback handoff, transfer, result, context, and lifecycle facets to
  the existing function plan and reference ordinary datatype plans instead of
  copying them.
- [x] Project adapter/trampoline symbols and ABI roles once. Do not synthesize
  backend handler names or rediscover dimension/length dependencies from
  emitted variables.
- [x] Validate unique callback sites, exact argument order, role availability,
  transport/writeback, dtype/rank/shape/length agreement, derived type identity,
  result compatibility, context balance, and validate/push/pop/release order.
- [x] Add direct plan-edit tests proving invalid callback roles, unbalanced
  lifecycle, or cross-backend disagreement fail before emission.

### Phase 10C — Context, Trampoline, GIL, And Scalar Values

- [x] Emit one thread-local stack per callback site, callable validation and
  strong-reference retention before native entry, reverse-order pop/release
  after return, and cleanup on every ordinary pre-entry failure.
- [x] Emit one C trampoline and separately linked external Fortran adapter from
  the completed ABI; validate the entering thread and context before Python
  conversion.
- [x] Acquire/release the GIL inside the trampoline and keep the outer
  callback-taking wrapper on the legacy-observed held-GIL envelope.
- [x] Lower void and scalar-value arguments/results first, then replay scalar
  callback success, nested re-entry, non-callable rejection, and balanced
  reference-count assertions in both build modes.

### Phase 10D — Primitive Scalar Values And Fixed-String Storage

- [x] Lower every primitive scalar callback argument as an owned NumPy scalar
  value. `Value(T)` changes only the native ABI; scalar reference writeback is
  unsupported and must be modeled as a callback result.
- [x] Lower fixed-string references as rank-zero fixed-width bytes storage with
  exact length, padding, and writeback. The semantic annotation remains
  `String[n]` and carries no native direction.
- [x] Reject runtime-length callback strings before emission; no adapter-local
  inference may change the representation.
- [x] Replay the scalar-value and string-storage cases from the combined
  callback fixture through source/generated-`.pyi` routes.

### Phase 10E — Array Arguments And Results

- [x] Lower array callback arguments from completed dtype, rank, shape,
  ordering, contiguity, and alignment facts. Reference arrays expose writable
  storage and copy back in adapter order.
- [x] Lower fixed-shape array results through one validated returned-address
  ABI and assign them into the native adapter result. Reject incomplete shape
  or unsupported ownership before emission.
- [x] Preserve output-array Python identity in the outer ordinary call and do
  not add a detached-copy fallback.
- [x] Replay `fcallback_array_f90` plus the combined array-storage callback and
  artifact assertions in both build modes.

### Phase 10F — Derived Arguments And Results

- [x] Reuse the exact Phase 8/9 type identity, opaque wrapper, owner-retention,
  and destroy/release actions for callback-local derived wrappers. Do not
  expose aggregate layout or introduce callback-specific storage ownership.
- [x] Borrow callback input wrappers only for the callback invocation; convert
  supported callback results to the completed native result storage and
  release temporary wrapper ownership exactly once.
- [x] Validate exact runtime class/type identity before using a returned
  derived address. Polymorphic, descriptor-backed, or unsupported derived
  callback forms retain exact blockers.
- [x] Replay `fcallback_derived_f90` and the combined derived callback after the
  Phase 9 constructor/class route is green.

### Phase 10G — Fatal Errors, Re-entry, And Cleanup

- [x] Route Python exceptions, argument-call mismatch, invalid callback result,
  missing context, and cross-thread entry through one
  traceback-plus-`abort()` action. Never return a fabricated value.
- [x] Prove nested same-thread callback calls use stack discipline and restore
  the previous callable/context after the inner call.
- [x] Prove ordinary validation or setup failures before native entry release
  every retained reference, and successful calls leave the callable reference
  count unchanged.
- [x] Run fatal cases in subprocesses for both source/generated-`.pyi` builds
  and assert the documented traceback/error text plus nonzero termination.

### Phase 10H — Production Routing, Documentation, And Closure

- [x] Add support-report lanes for callback context, scalar value/storage,
  fixed strings, arrays, derived values, result conversion, same-thread
  re-entry, and fatal errors.
- [x] Add one reduced compiled direct-plan node per dependency-closed lane and
  update its migration-matrix row only after artifact and runtime parity.
- [x] Prove eligible callback units select the production wrapper-plan route;
  unsupported callback policy must keep the whole generation unit on one
  exact blocker.
- [x] Synchronize callback guide/reference, semantic `.pyi` reference, feature
  matrix, callback README, source map, and checklist coverage with the direct
  implementation.
- [x] Run focused policy/plan/backend tests, every callback wrapper node in
  source/generated-`.pyi` modes, the wrapper suite excluding LAPACK, the
  wrapper complexity checker, documentation checks, whitespace, and the
  required static-analysis suite.
- [x] Close Phase 10 only when every supported immediate callback unit routes
  directly, no callback plan falls back after generation starts, and every
  stored/optional/asynchronous/cross-thread or incomplete callback form has an
  exact retained blocker. Stop before Phase 11.

Closure evidence (2026-07-16): callback policy, editable-plan validation,
binding/bridge artifacts, scalar/string/array/derived conversion, nested
same-thread re-entry, reference cleanup, and subprocess fatal-boundary tests
all passed through the direct route. The same 184-test focused batch and
449-test non-LAPACK wrapper replay used for Phase 9 closure cover the complete
immediate-callback matrix. Required static checks passed with the explicit
Radon base noted above, and implementation stopped before Phase 11.

### Phase 10 Expansion Gate

- [x] Inventory the public callback contract, semantic prototype records,
  legacy lowering/codegen owners, source/generated-`.pyi` runtime fixtures,
  context lifetime, re-entry/GIL behavior, exception/abort behavior, and every
  supported scalar/string/array/derived argument-result combination.
- [x] Define the Phase 9/10/11 boundary and retain explicit blockers for stored,
  optional, asynchronous, cross-thread, incomplete-signature, and unsupported
  callback forms.
- [x] Split implementation into dependency-ordered Phase 10A-H sub-lanes with
  policy, typed plan, validation, lowering, compiled parity, production
  routing, documentation, and closure gates.

## Phase 11 — Cross-Cutting Wrapper Suite Completion

Implementation status: complete. The pre-Phase-11 ledger contained 236
wrapper-plan nodes, five dual-route array parity nodes, 113 passing legacy-route
nodes, 95 non-generating nodes, and two deferred real-library nodes. The final
forced-plan sweep passed 435 of 449 non-real-library nodes before obsolete
dual-route artifact assertions were removed; its two shared implementation
gaps were Fortran-ordered strided ndarray validation and static `nopass` method
dispatch, both now resolved through existing policy/runtime paths.

The ordered output aggregator now combines direct and hidden native results
with visible scalar, string, array, and derived writeback. It converts each
value once in public result order and releases every earlier Python reference
if a later conversion or tuple allocation fails; the former single-result and
"native result plus writeback" blockers are removed.

Scope: existing wrapper tests whose generation units combine completed semantic
lanes or exercise build and runtime behavior rather than introducing one new
datatype lane.

Implement in these dependency-ordered waves:

1. reconcile the five reduced array dual-route nodes and remove stale Phase 7
   exclusion bookkeeping where their completed actual-source policy now permits
   production routing;
2. migrate source/semantic-`.pyi` build modes, edited contracts, external
   symbols, multiple-source linkage, and independent native bundles through one
   shared route and planner;
3. migrate mixed scalar/string/array/handle/derived/module/class generation
   units without adding per-test or per-datatype fallback;
4. migrate naming, generic interfaces, defined operators, OpenMP/runtime policy,
   and remaining public-surface orchestration; and
5. require the live nondeferred ledger to contain only `wrapper-plan` or
   justified `not-applicable` nodes before Phase 12 begins.

- [x] Reconcile every remaining `legacy` or `dual-route` matrix row by owning
  test area: `build_from_source`, `build_from_pyi`, `edit_pyi_contracts`,
  `external_routines`, `multiple_files`, `naming`, `runtime_behavior`, and
  `real_libraries`.
- [x] Group remaining rows into dependency-ordered waves by their actual
  unsupported owner paths. Do not implement a broad test directory as one
  special case and do not add per-test backend fallbacks.
- [x] For every newly discovered semantic or backend gap, expand the applicable
  earlier lane or add an explicit sub-lane here, then follow the complete
  policy -> plan -> backend -> emission -> compiled parity -> route sequence.
- [x] Prove source-driven and semantic-`.pyi`-driven builds use the same route
  selector and wrapper planner while retaining their existing build assertions.
- [x] Prove edited-policy contracts, external symbols, multiple-source builds,
  naming/generic interfaces, runtime policies, recursion, OpenMP, and real
  library-independent native bundles preserve their existing assertions
  through the wrapper-plan route.
- [x] Keep non-wrapper-generating tests, including layout and generated-`.pyi`
  checks, marked `not-applicable` to route selection but passing in the same
  suite.
- [x] Run every `tests/wrapper` test except
  `test_real_blas_lapack.py` locally and in CI as the pre-cutover gate.
- [x] Finish this phase only when every nondeferred matrix row is either
  `wrapper-plan` or justified `not-applicable`; no nondeferred row may remain
  `legacy` or `dual-route`. BLAS/LAPACK rows remain
  `deferred-real-library` until Phase 12.

Closure evidence (2026-07-16): the Phase 11 ledger contains 344 canonical
wrapper-plan nodes, 95 justified non-generating nodes, two deferred
real-library nodes, and no legacy or dual-route node. The complete local
pre-cutover suite outside the shared BLAS/LAPACK file passed all 439 collected
tests. Mixed outputs use the ordered aggregator, Fortran-ordered strided array
validation reuses the shared array-actual runtime path, and static `nopass`
methods reuse the completed class invocation path; no per-test route or
backend fallback was added.

## Phase 12 — Cutover And Removal

Implementation status: complete. Local BLAS evidence is recorded below;
LAPACK execution remains intentionally CI-only.

Local verification boundary: run the BLAS generation unit locally. Do not run
the LAPACK generation unit locally; make its wrapper-plan invocation runnable
in GitHub Actions and use that job for LAPACK parity and cutover evidence.

External-interface parameter lists preserve native ABI order, while their
declarations may be topologically ordered from the plan's explicit array
extent-reference roles. This permits a later scalar extent dummy to be
declared before an earlier array dummy without reordering the native call.

Cutover contract: source builds, semantic-`.pyi` builds, Makefile generation,
manifest replay, and strict-name validation all use completed policy ->
`WrapperPlan` -> `WrapperCodeGenerator`. The build API has no route selector,
rollback flag, or silent fallback; an unsupported owner path fails before any
backend or legacy lowering runs.

- [x] Re-audit collected Python test nodes under `tests/wrapper` and reconcile
  them with the migration matrix. No test may be missing from the matrix.
- [x] After every other migration row is complete, restore the full
  `test_real_blas_lapack.py` run and any required native-cache preparation in
  local opt-in verification and GitHub Actions.
- [x] Run BLAS locally through the canonical route using its existing contract,
  import, ABI, and runtime assertions. Run the equivalent exact LAPACK node in
  the dedicated GitHub Actions real-library matrix; do not run it locally.
- [x] Require every wrapper-generating test row to be `wrapper-plan`; no row
  remains `legacy`, `dual-route`, or `deferred-real-library`.
- [x] Configure the complete `tests/wrapper` suite in CI with ordinary tests in
  the main matrix and the full BLAS/LAPACK nodes in the cached real-library
  matrix.
- [x] Confirm no wrapper build lane uses the old
  `semantic_ir_to_codegen_ast()` path. The old lowering is no longer a supported
  test owner and receives no focused compatibility coverage.
- [x] Remove route support tracking and fallback diagnostics; whole-generation
  units now either validate and generate one plan or fail on exact owner-path
  support diagnostics before emission.
- [x] Retain rollback only until the live ledger is reconciled, then remove it
  in one cutover without compatibility flags or per-function fallback.
- [x] Do not move modified isolated nodes or printers back into the legacy
  package during migration. After final cutover, remove the legacy package
  pieces proven unused and keep `x2py.wrapper_codegen` as the canonical
  generator rather than performing a second package rename.
- [x] Keep semantic `.pyi` emission under `x2py.wrapper_codegen.printers` and
  retire focused tests of the old semantic AST, bridge, binding, and printer
  implementation before deleting the legacy package.
- [x] Remove the temporary legacy route and its route diagnostics after every
  live generation unit is supported; do not replace it with compatibility
  shims or per-function fallback.
- [x] Remove migration-only dual-route orchestration after the complete existing
  wrapper suite proves the wrapper-plan route and legacy rollback is no longer
  supported. Keep the existing behavioral fixtures and assertions.
- [x] Keep source printers only for the remaining generated source fragments they
  still own, or replace them with narrower emitters once the model layer is no
  longer needed.

Closure evidence (2026-07-16): the final live ledger contains 346 canonical
wrapper-plan nodes, 75 justified non-generating nodes, and zero legacy,
dual-route, or deferred nodes. The complete local suite outside the shared
real-library file passed 419 tests; the exact BLAS full-library node passed
locally; and the exact BLAS and LAPACK nodes are runnable as independent legs
of the cached GitHub Actions real-library matrix. LAPACK was intentionally not
run locally, so its runtime result remains CI evidence. Focused semantic and
compiled class/module policy tests passed 80 tests, all wrapper-codegen tests
passed 352 tests, and documentation plus structural layout checks passed 1,142
tests. Ruff lint/format, Bandit, Vulture, the wrapper-codegen complexity check,
the Radon policy against explicit base `main`, advisory Radon complexity and
maintainability reports, and `git diff --check` all passed.

## Verification

- [x] Documentation changes run
  `python3 -m pytest -q tests/docs/test_examples.py tests/docs/test_structure.py`
  and `git diff --check`.
- [x] Wrapper-plan code changes run the affected existing `tests/wrapper` nodes,
  the minimal intermediate contract tests required above, and the required
  static-analysis suite from `AGENTS.md`.
- [x] Wrapper-codegen implementation changes pass
  `python3 tools/check_wrapper_codegen_complexity.py` with no handler waiver.
- [x] Runtime wrapper tests cover every changed generated behavior.
- [x] Every migrated lane completed legacy-oracle comparison before cutover;
  final tests now exercise only the canonical wrapper-plan route and retain the
  existing behavior and ABI-relevant call assertions.
- [x] Structural dependency tests prove complete generator isolation: no
  imports from `x2py.wrapper_codegen` to `x2py.codegen` or in the reverse
  direction.
- [x] BLAS and LAPACK full-library wrapper tests remained excluded locally and in
  GitHub Actions throughout Phases 0-11. At the explicit Phase 12 gate, enable
  BLAS locally and in GitHub Actions, enable LAPACK only in GitHub Actions, and
  keep local LAPACK execution disabled.

## Completion Record

- [x] The final report for each lane names the plan actions added, the binding
  and bridge handlers they dispatch to, and the handoff specs validated.
- [x] No unsupported wrapper lane uses old lowering/codegen; focused tests now
  target completed policy, `WrapperPlan`, `WrapperCodeGenerator`, or compiled
  public behavior rather than `ir2ast.py` and `x2py.codegen` internals.
- [x] The final cutover report includes the completed `tests/wrapper` migration
  matrix and confirms every wrapper-generating row uses the wrapper-plan route.
- [x] The final report includes focused verification commands and results.
- [x] The final report includes the changed-stage breakdown required by
  `AGENTS.md` and names every test file added or updated with the behavior it
  covers.

## Post-Cutover Legacy Codegen Removal

The legacy `x2py.codegen` package, `x2py/semantics/ir2ast.py`, and the obsolete
`x2py/compiling/python_wrapper.py` pipeline are removed together. No alias,
fallback, compatibility import, or rejection-only test preserves that route.

Required behavior remains with its current owner: completed semantic policy
tests for semantic decisions, `tests/wrapper_codegen/` for plans and direct
source generation, and compiled `tests/wrapper/` cases for public Python
behavior and native ABI outcomes. Static-analysis baselines cover only source
that remains in the repository.
## Session Continuation Protocol

The stable continuation prompt is:

```text
Continue implementing the wrapper-plan migration checklist.
```

On continuation: read this checklist and `AGENTS.md`; inspect the dirty
worktree; choose the first unchecked dependency-closed item; replay the
existing passing wrapper test before extending a lane; implement code and tests
together; run required verification; and check items only from live evidence.
Do not reset unrelated user changes, infer missing policy in lowering, or use a
new fallback after direct plan generation starts.
