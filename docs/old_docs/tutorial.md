# Tutorial

This tutorial is the main user guide for the supported x2py pipeline from
native source to wrapper builds and semantic policy completion. The commands use
version-controlled fixtures so they can be run from the repository root.

For additional copy-paste commands and Python snippets, continue to the
[examples cookbook](examples.md). For detailed user-facing contracts, use the
[semantic `.pyi` format](pyi_format.md), [semantic IR reference](semantics.md),
and
[diagnostic code registry](diagnostic_codes.md). Implementation and parser
maintenance material starts in the [developer guide](developper_guide.md).

## Current Scope

x2py builds one Python extension by default when given one or more ordered
Fortran source files:

```bash
python3 -m x2py solver.f90
```

x2py also supports three explicit inspection stages:

1. Parse wrapper-relevant Fortran or C declarations.
2. Convert parser facts to language-neutral semantic IR.
3. Emit an editable semantic `.pyi` interface.

The current runtime wrapper build path is implemented for Fortran source
files. C and edited `.pyi` inspection does not imply that a compiled Python
extension exists. Runtime wrapping of user-supplied C libraries will be added
later.

The implemented Fortran build pipeline is:

```text
ordered Fortran sources
  -> compiler preprocessing and target-type probing
  -> parser project facts
  -> semantic IR
  -> codegen AST
  -> generated Fortran bind(C) bridge
  -> generated C/CPython binding and native binding support
  -> compiled and linked Python extension
```

The inspection pipeline is shared by Fortran and C:

```text
Fortran or C source
  -> parser facts
  -> semantic IR
  -> editable .pyi
```

Fortran wrapper generation continues from semantic IR into native codegen.
The current C path stops at semantic IR and `.pyi`; the generated C source used by
the Fortran backend is not a wrapper backend for C inputs.

Parsers preserve source facts. Semantic IR normalizes those facts. Edited
`.pyi` files are the user-controlled inspection and wrapper contract when
source alone cannot express enough policy. The normal Fortran build remains
source-driven, and the implemented `.pyi` build subset can instead consume the
edited `.pyi` as the Python API source of truth when native object, module,
include, and link inputs are supplied. Wrapper planning reports errors rather than
guessing ownership, callback lifetime, ABI shims, or Python-visible
projections.

## Before You Start

x2py requires Python 3.10 or newer. For native source input, the shared CLI
runs compiler preprocessing:

- C defaults to `cc`.
- Fortran defaults to `gfortran`.
- Use `--compiler`, `--compile-commands`, or a custom preprocessing template
  when the native project uses different flags or tools.

Install the checkout and inspect the CLI:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -e .
python3 -m x2py --help
```

The examples below use `python3`. Replace it with the Python 3.10+ executable
for your environment when necessary. After installation, the `x2py` console
command is equivalent to `python3 -m x2py`.

## Fortran Walkthrough

Input (`tests/data/fortran/general/basic_subroutine.f90`):

<!-- x2py-doc-source: tests/data/fortran/general/basic_subroutine.f90 -->
```fortran
module m1
contains
subroutine add1(n, x)
  integer, intent(in) :: n
  real(kind=8), intent(inout), dimension(n) :: x
end subroutine add1
end module m1
```

### 1. Parse The Source

Recognizable Fortran files do not require `--language fortran`:

<!-- x2py-doc-test: exact -->
```bash
python3 -m x2py parse tests/data/fortran/general/basic_subroutine.f90
```

Expected output:

<!-- x2py-doc-test-output -->
```text
File: tests/data/fortran/general/basic_subroutine.f90
  Modules: 1
    - module m1 (vars=0, uses=0)
      Procedures: 1
        - subroutine add1(n:integer[0], x:real(8)[1])
```

This is a compact source-fact report. It describes the native module and
procedure signature; it does not decide wrapper policy.

### 2. Inspect Semantic IR

Convert the parsed source to language-neutral semantic IR:

<!-- x2py-doc-test: run -->
```bash
python3 -m x2py semantics tests/data/fortran/general/basic_subroutine.f90
```

`--semantics` prints a machine-readable payload containing `semantic_modules`
and generated `pyi` text. Use it when another tool needs structured semantic
data.

### 3. Generate The Editable Interface

<!-- x2py-doc-test: exact -->
```bash
python3 -m x2py generate --pyi tests/data/fortran/general/basic_subroutine.f90
```

Expected output:

<!-- x2py-doc-test-output -->
```python
File: tests/data/fortran/general/basic_subroutine.f90
@native_call([Addr(Arg(0)), Arg(1)])
def add1(
    n: Int32,
    x: Float64[n]
) -> None: ...
```

The stub preserves the exact native contract:

- `n` is a read-only scalar value at the Python boundary; the native call uses
  the address of x2py's converted native slot because the Fortran dummy argument
  is not declared with `value`.
- `x` is a writable rank-one array whose extent is `n`.

Write the stub to an explicit path:

```bash
python3 -m x2py generate --pyi tests/data/fortran/general/basic_subroutine.f90 \
  --out basic_subroutine.pyi
```

Use `--pyi --out` without a path to write a `.pyi` beside each input source.

### 4. Build A Fortran Extension

Use the checked runtime example for a complete build and call:

<!-- x2py-doc-source: tests/data/fortran/wrapper/feature_parity/runtime/fruntime_abi_f90.f90 -->
```fortran
module fruntime_abi_f90
contains
  real(8) function scale(value, factor) result(output)
    real(8), intent(in) :: value
    real(8), intent(in) :: factor
    output = value * factor
  end function scale
end module fruntime_abi_f90
```

Build it into an explicit directory:

```bash
python3 -m x2py tests/data/fortran/wrapper/feature_parity/runtime/fruntime_abi_f90.f90 \
  --out-dir build/fruntime_abi \
  --json
```

With no inspection stage selected, recognizable Fortran input follows the
wrapper-build path. The JSON payload reports the extension name, shared-library
path, generated wrapper sources, and all build artifacts.

Import and call the module:

```python
import sys

import numpy as np

sys.path.insert(0, "build/fruntime_abi")
import fruntime_abi_f90

value = fruntime_abi_f90.scale(np.float64(3.0), np.float64(2.5))
assert value == np.float64(7.5)
```

The exact NumPy scalar types are intentional. The wrapper validates the native
ABI contract instead of silently converting arbitrary Python numeric objects.

Without `--out-dir`, intermediate files and the ABI-suffixed extension go into
`__x2py__` in the current working directory, while a direct CLI build writes
its stable `<module>.so` alias there unless `--out` gives it an explicit path. Use
`--verbose` to print
the executed compiler and linker commands.

### 6. Understand The Generated Boundary

The build lowers semantic IR through two native layers:

1. A generated Fortran `bind(C)` bridge adapts Fortran calling conventions,
   arrays, derived types, optional values, and results to a C-compatible ABI.
2. A generated C/CPython binding validates Python objects, manages ownership
   and references, invokes the bridge, and creates Python or NumPy results.

The header-only native binding support is compiled as part of the generated
CPython binding. The final link combines user objects, the Fortran bridge, and
the CPython binding into one extension module. Generated sources are build artifacts; the
public behavior is the documented semantic and wrapper contract.

For a build-system-controlled workflow, generate sources and a GNU Make build
without compiling:

```bash
python3 -m x2py generate --makefile tests/data/fortran/wrapper/feature_parity/runtime/fruntime_abi_f90.f90 \
  --out-dir build/fruntime_abi \
  --json
```

Then run `make -f build/fruntime_abi/Makefile.x2py`. The Makefile exposes
`FC`, `CC`, `X2PY_LD`, `X2PY_FFLAGS`, `X2PY_CFLAGS`, and `X2PY_LDFLAGS`.
The [Fortran wrapper guide](fortran_wrapper.md) defines the complete Python API
and the [examples cookbook](examples.md#fortran-runtime-wrapper-examples)
contains multi-source and Python API recipes.

## C Walkthrough

Input (`tests/data/c/general/math_api.h`):

<!-- x2py-doc-source: tests/data/c/general/math_api.h -->
```c
#ifndef X2PY_GENERAL_MATH_API_H
#define X2PY_GENERAL_MATH_API_H

double norm2(int n, const double x[static 1]);
void scale(int n, double alpha, double x[static 1]);
double dot(int n, const double *restrict x, const double *restrict y);
void fill_identity3(double a[static 3][3]);

#endif
```

C inputs require explicit C mode:

<!-- x2py-doc-test: exact -->
```bash
python3 -m x2py parse tests/data/c/general/math_api.h --language c
```

Expected output:

<!-- x2py-doc-test-output -->
```text
File: tests/data/c/general/math_api.h
  Language: c
  Functions: 4
  Structs: 0
  Unions: 0
  Enums: 0
  Typedefs: 0
  Variables: 0
  Macros: 0
  Includes: 0
  Diagnostics: 0
```

Generate the semantic `.pyi`:

<!-- x2py-doc-test: exact -->
```bash
python3 -m x2py generate --pyi tests/data/c/general/math_api.h --language c
```

Expected output:

<!-- x2py-doc-test-output -->
```python
File: tests/data/c/general/math_api.h
def norm2(
    n: Int,
    x: Float64[1]
) -> Float64: ...

def scale(
    n: Int,
    alpha: Float64,
    x: Float64[1]
) -> None: ...

def dot(
    n: Int,
    x: Addr(Float64),
    y: Addr(Float64)
) -> Float64: ...

def fill_identity3(
    a: Float64[3, 3]
) -> None: ...
```

The C frontend supports wrapper-oriented declaration and signature extraction.
It does not yet lower user C inputs into a compiled extension. That backend
will be added later after its ABI, ownership, and runtime contracts are proved.
The C frontend is not a C++ frontend or a full compiler frontend. The
[supported boundaries](#supported-boundaries) below summarize the user-facing
scope.

## Choose A Stage

| Goal | Command flag | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Build a Fortran extension | no inspection stage flag | Generated sources, objects, and importable extension |
| Generate an editable native build | `--makefile` | Generated sources and `Makefile.x2py`, without compilation |
| Inspect native parser facts | `--parse` | Human-readable report |
| Consume full parser facts | `--parse --json` | Parser payload |
| Consume language-neutral facts | `--semantics` | Semantic payload |
| Create or inspect the editable contract | `--pyi` | Semantic `.pyi` text |
| Diagnose an unsupported wrapper build | no inspection stage flag | Wrapper-plan error |

Build mode is separate from inspection mode: `--makefile` cannot be combined
with `--parse`, `--semantics`, or `--pyi`.
Both build modes currently require Fortran source files rather than directories
or `.pyi` inputs.

## Select Inputs And Language

Language selection follows these supported rules:

- Recognizable Fortran files can omit `--language`.
- `.pyi` contract input can omit `--language`.
- C files require `--language c`.
- Directories and unknown-suffix source files require an explicit language.
- Explicit language selection must agree with recognizable source suffixes.

Parse a directory recursively:

```bash
python3 -m x2py parse path/to/fortran_sources --language fortran
python3 -m x2py parse path/to/c_sources --language c
```

Parse multiple explicit inputs:

```bash
python3 -m x2py parse src/types.f90 src/api.f90 --language fortran
python3 -m x2py parse include/types.h include/api.h --language c
```

For the direct Python parser APIs, paths, source strings, project mappings,
path sequences, and directories are supported. Those direct APIs parse raw or
already-controlled input; they do not run the shared CLI compiler
preprocessing pipeline.

## Use Native Project Compiler Flags

The CLI preprocesses native source before parsing it. Pass the same important
flags used by the native build:

```bash
python3 -m x2py parse include/api.h --language c \
  --compiler clang \
  -I include \
  -D API_EXPORT= \
  --std c11 \
  --compiler-arg=--sysroot=/opt/sdk
```

Use a C compilation database when one is available:

```bash
python3 -m x2py.c_type_probe --compiler clang \
  --compiler-arg=--target=aarch64-linux-gnu \
  --runner=qemu-aarch64 \
  > build/aarch64-c-types.json
```

For normal direct-compiler C semantic and `.pyi` stages, x2py
automatically probes primitive widths and plain `char` signedness using the
selected compiler and target flags. It caches the result by compiler identity
and target configuration, so repeated runs do not recompile the probe. The
standalone probe exposes cache refresh and runner controls for explicit target
inspection.

NumPy types are used as the Python-side dtype mapping, not as the ABI probe:
NumPy describes the interpreter host and can disagree with a cross compiler or
selected sysroot. The standalone report is an inspection output; it is not fed
back into semantic conversion as a separate input path.

For Fortran:

```bash
python3 -m x2py generate --pyi src/api.f90 --language fortran \
  --compiler gfortran \
  -I include \
  -D USE_MPI \
  --std f2008 \
  --compiler-arg=-fdefault-real-8
```

For direct-compiler Fortran semantic, `.pyi`, and wrapper-build stages, x2py
resolves compiler-dependent kind expressions and measures the storage of every
intrinsic type used by the source. This matters for processor-dependent
numeric kinds and flags such as `-fdefault-real-8` or
`-fdefault-integer-8`. Expression and storage probes are cached by compiler
identity and target configuration. Source-driven builds apply native Fortran
compiler flags to the internal probe as well as native compilation. The
standalone report is an inspection output and exposes its own runner, cache,
and refresh controls.

Compiler preprocessing preserves a recipe in machine-readable parser output,
including the selected compiler, arguments, includes, source mappings, and
diagnostics. See the [examples cookbook](examples.md#compiler-preprocessing)
for more supported preprocessing modes.

## Inspect Target Datatype Mappings

Generate the native-to-semantic-to-NumPy scalar mapping for the selected
compiler target:

```bash
python3 -m x2py.type_mapping_report --language c
python3 -m x2py.type_mapping_report --language fortran
```

Pass `--compiler` and repeated `--compiler-arg` options to inspect a different
compiler target or target-changing flags. Both mapping commands use persistent
probe caches; `--cache-dir`, `--refresh`, and repeated `--runner` options
control reuse and cross-target execution. The generated
[Linux x86_64 C and Fortran examples](semantics.md#generated-linux-x86_64-mapping-example)
show the complete input facts and resulting NumPy dtype names used by the
GitHub Actions profile. The Fortran table includes modern kinds and legacy
spellings. It also shows the important distinction between fixed-width
`complex*8` and compiler-kind `complex(kind=8)`, and identifies
`character*N` as length syntax.

## Edit A Semantic `.pyi`

Generated `.pyi` files describe exact native contracts by default. They do not
silently hide native arguments, infer ownership, or turn output arguments into
Python return values.

The loader accepts semantic interface syntax such as:

```python
from typing import Final
from x2py.contracts import prototype

nmax: Final[Int32] = 32

class state:
    count: Int32
    values: Float64[nmax]

@prototype
def objective(value: Float64) -> Float64: ...

def integrate(
    callback: objective,
    x0: Float64
) -> Float64: ...
```

A complete named prototype resolves a callback-signature wrapper-planning error. A
placeholder such as `Procedure` remains incomplete because its argument and
result types are unknown.

Supported projection metadata such as `@native_call(...)` is parsed and
preserved. The source-driven Fortran wrapper executes the built-in projection
rules documented in the [Fortran wrapper guide](fortran_wrapper.md). The
implemented `.pyi` build subset consumes edited `.pyi` files for wrapper
generation, but arbitrary edited `@native_call` runtime lowering remains a
separate parity item. See the [semantic `.pyi` format](pyi_format.md) before
writing custom annotations.

## Use The Python API

The package exports `build_fortran_extension` as well as parser, semantic
conversion and `.pyi` helpers. The
[examples cookbook](examples.md#build-and-import-through-the-python-api) shows
a complete temporary-directory build and import.

Parse inline source:

<!-- x2py-doc-test: run -->
```python
from x2py import parse_c_file, parse_fortran_file

c_file = parse_c_file("int add(int a, int b);", filename="inline.h")
fortran_file = parse_fortran_file(
    "subroutine ping()\nend subroutine ping\n",
    filename="inline.f90",
)

print([function.name for function in c_file.functions])
print([procedure.name for procedure in fortran_file.procedures])
```

Parse a project from an in-memory mapping:

<!-- x2py-doc-test: run -->
```python
from x2py import parse_c_project

project = parse_c_project(
    {
        "types.h": "typedef int api_int;",
        "api.h": '#include "types.h"\napi_int answer(void);',
    }
)

print(sorted(project.files))
print(sorted(project.functions))
```

Convert and emit a stub:

<!-- x2py-doc-test: run -->
```python
from x2py import (
    c_file_to_semantic_modules,
    emit_module_stubs,
    parse_c_file,
)

parsed = parse_c_file("int add(int a, int b);", filename="inline.h")
modules = c_file_to_semantic_modules(parsed)
stubs = emit_module_stubs(modules)

print(stubs["inline"])
```

The [examples cookbook](examples.md#python-api-examples) contains additional
verified Python API workflows.

## Understand Stage Errors

Errors belong to the stage with the facts needed to explain them:

- unresolved semantic types;
- unresolved array-shape symbols or missing compile-time constants;
- incomplete callback signatures;
- ambiguous C pointer ownership;
- C variadic or unspecified-parameter functions;
- unsupported union, bitfield, atomic, volatile, or ABI-sensitive contracts;
- an empty public API.

When the missing information is expressible in supported semantic `.pyi`
syntax, edit the generated interface and rerun the wrapper build. Some errors require
additional wrapper policy or backend implementation and cannot currently be
resolved by an annotation.

## Supported Boundaries

Use x2py for the behavior implemented and tested today:

- generated and compiled CPython extensions from one or more ordered Fortran
  source files;
- generated Fortran `bind(C)` bridges, C/CPython bindings, and native binding support
  for the contracts in the [Fortran wrapper guide](fortran_wrapper.md);
- wrapper-relevant Fortran and C source-fact extraction;
- compiler-preprocessed CLI workflows;
- typed parser models and language-neutral semantic IR;
- semantic `.pyi` emission and loading;
- semantic `.pyi` emission and loading.

Do not assume current support for:

- C++ parsing;
- full compiler-grade parsing or ABI validation;
- automatic pointer ownership or lifetime inference;
- automatic callback lifetime/threading policy;
- generated or compiled runtime wrappers from user-supplied C inputs;
- direct CLI wrapper builds from edited `.pyi` files;
- arbitrary edited `@native_call` projection execution through the CLI build.

The [semantic `.pyi` format](pyi_format.md) is the maintained user-facing
contract for editable stubs. The [semantic IR reference](semantics.md) owns
datatype mapping and IR details.
Implementation inventories and parser-maintenance references are linked from
the [developer guide](developper_guide.md#references).
