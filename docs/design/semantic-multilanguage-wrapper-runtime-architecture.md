# Semantic Multilanguage Wrapper and Interoperability Runtime

> **Status:** This is a long-term architecture document, not a statement that
> every backend below exists. The source-driven Fortran-to-Python wrapper is
> implemented and documented in
> [the Fortran wrapper guide](../user-guide/fortran-wrapper.md). C parsing, semantic IR,
> `.pyi`, and readiness are implemented, but the runtime backend for
> user-supplied C inputs will be added later. Other language backends and the
> broader coercion runtime remain design goals.

## Vision

The goal of this project is to create a modern interoperability framework capable of wrapping and connecting libraries written in multiple native languages through a unified semantic API layer.

The system should:

* wrap native libraries from:
  * Fortran
  * C
  * C++
  * Rust
  * CUDA
  * and potentially more languages later
* expose clean Python APIs
* support semantic interoperability between different native runtimes
* support automatic coercions and conversions
* support runtime constraints and validation contracts
* support zero-copy array interoperability when possible
* avoid compiler dependence whenever possible
* avoid forcing users to modify native code
* avoid the limitations of SWIG/f2py-style systems
* support wrapping libraries even when the source code is unavailable

The project is not merely a wrapper generator.

It is a:

* semantic wrapper compiler
* interoperability runtime
* runtime coercion engine
* runtime validation engine
* runtime validation contract system
* language-independent semantic API system

---

## Core Philosophy

The most important architectural decision is:

> The semantic API layer is the source of truth.

NOT:

* parser ASTs
* compiler internals
* ABI details
* native language syntax

The system separates:

| Concern | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Semantic API | `.pyi`-style interface layer |
| Runtime coercions | conversion registry and coercion graph |
| Runtime validation | constraint checks on adapted values |
| Validation contracts | reusable preconditions, postconditions, and invariants |
| Native ABI | backend adapters |
| Source parsing | optional helper |

This separation is the foundation of the whole architecture.

---

## Why Existing Systems Are Not Enough

### SWIG

SWIG is:

* parser-centric
* macro-heavy
* difficult to debug
* weak for scientific arrays
* poor for runtime semantics
* poor for modern interoperability

It also becomes difficult to maintain when:

* ownership becomes complex
* NumPy arrays are involved
* GPU arrays are involved
* runtime conversions are needed
* API remapping becomes advanced

### f2py

f2py is:

* Fortran-specific
* procedural
* compiler/build-centric
* not semantic-runtime oriented
* weak for object systems
* weak for heterogeneous runtimes

### pybind11

pybind11 is excellent for:

* clean bindings
* modern Python APIs

But:

* bindings are handwritten
* there is no semantic interoperability layer
* no runtime coercion model
* no language-independent abstraction

---

## High-Level Architecture

The architecture is composed of multiple layers.

```text
Native libraries/sources
        ↓
Optional parser frontends
        ↓
Canonical semantic interface layer (.pyi)
        ↓
Semantic IR
        ↓
Runtime coercion engine
        ↓
Runtime validation engine
        ↓
Runtime validation contracts
        ↓
Backend adapters
        ↓
Generated CPython extension
        ↓
Python API
```

The validation engine enforces concrete checks. Validation contracts describe when those checks run, what they guarantee, and how failures are reported.

---

## Canonical Semantic Interface Layer

The `.pyi`-style interface file is the central abstraction.

It defines:

* semantic APIs
* classes
* functions
* methods
* semantic types
* allowed coercions
* constraints
* validation contracts
* ownership semantics
* API remapping

This layer is:

* language-independent
* parser-independent
* editable
* human-readable
* stable

The native parser is NOT the source of truth.

The `.pyi` interface file is.

---

## Example Basic Wrapper

Suppose native Fortran code contains a procedural matrix API:

```fortran
module sparse_mod

  type :: sparse_matrix
  end type

contains

  subroutine create_sparse(A, nrows, ncols)
    type(sparse_matrix), intent(out) :: A
    integer, intent(in) :: nrows, ncols
  end subroutine

  subroutine sparse_multiply(A, x, y)
    type(sparse_matrix), intent(in) :: A
    real(8), intent(in) :: x(:)
    real(8), intent(out) :: y(:)
  end subroutine

end module
```

The semantic interface may expose a Pythonic object model:

```python
@bind("sparse_matrix")
class SparseMatrix:

    @bind("create_sparse")
    def __init__(
        self,
        nrows: int[Positive],
        ncols: int[Positive],
    ) -> None: ...

    @bind("sparse_multiply")
    @contract(
        pre=lambda c: c.args.x.shape == (c.self.ncols,) and c.args.x.dtype == "float64",
        post=lambda c: c.result.shape == (c.self.nrows,) and c.result.dtype == "float64",
    )
    def multiply(
        self,
        x: Float64Vector[From(np.ndarray), CPUResident],
    ) -> Float64Vector: ...
```

This allows:

* semantic API redesign
* Pythonic APIs
* decoupling native APIs from exposed APIs
* explicit validation of user-facing expectations
* reusable runtime checks without changing native source code

---

## API Projection

The framework allows transforming procedural APIs into clean object-oriented APIs.

Native:

```fortran
call sparse_multiply(A, x, y)
```

Exposed Python API:

```python
y = A.multiply(x)
```

This is called:

> semantic API projection.

The projection records how Python-level `self`, arguments, and return values map to native parameters.

---

## Semantic Types

Semantic types represent:

> what an object means conceptually.

NOT:

* its memory layout
* its native language representation
* its ABI representation

Examples:

* `Float64Matrix`
* `SparseMatrix`
* `Tensor3D`
* `CSRMatrix`
* `ComplexVector`
* `DeviceBuffer`

Semantic types are language-independent.

---

## Coercions

Coercions define:

> how one type can be adapted into another.

Examples:

* `int -> float`
* `np.ndarray -> Float64Matrix`
* `TorchTensor -> Float64Matrix`
* `CuPyArray -> DeviceBuffer`

Coercions should be explicit in the semantic interface so that the runtime can reject surprising conversions and explain accepted ones.

---

## Declaring Coercions

The semantic interface can declare allowed coercions.

Example:

```python
def scale(alpha: float[From(int)], x: Float64Vector) -> Float64Vector: ...
```

Meaning:

```text
int -> float
```

is an allowed coercion for `alpha`.

---

## Matrix Example

```python
def solve(
    A: Float64Matrix[
        From(np.ndarray),
        ORDER_F,
        Writable,
        "N", "N",
    ],
    b: Float64Vector[
        From(np.ndarray),
        "N",
    ],
) -> Float64Vector["N"]: ...
```

This means:

* target semantic type for `A`:
  * `Float64Matrix`
* allowed coercion for `A`:
  * `np.ndarray -> Float64Matrix`
* required constraints for `A`:
  * Fortran-contiguous (`ORDER_F`)
  * writable
  * square shape
* cross-argument contract:
  * `A.shape[0] == A.shape[1] == b.shape[0]`

---

## Constraints

Constraints define:

> requirements the final adapted representation must satisfy.

Constraints are NOT coercions.

Examples:

* `Positive`
* `Writable`
* `ORDER_F`
* `ORDER_C`
* `CPUResident`
* shape subscriptions such as `Float64["N", "N"]`
* `Aligned(64)`
* `Finite`
* `NonNull`

A constraint is usually local to one value: dtype, shape, device, alignment, mutability, ownership, or value range.

---

## Runtime Coercion Engine

The runtime coercion engine is responsible for converting accepted Python objects into semantic runtime objects.

Responsibilities:

* find an allowed conversion path from the observed input type to the target semantic type
* rank competing conversion paths by cost, safety, and zero-copy potential
* apply conversions in order
* preserve ownership and lifetime metadata
* emit a trace that can be shown in diagnostics

Example conversion trace:

```text
argument A:
  np.ndarray(shape=(10, 10), dtype=float64, order=C)
    -> copy_to_fortran_order
  Float64Matrix(shape=(10, 10), dtype=float64, order=F, owner=temporary)
```

---

## Runtime Validation Engine

The runtime validation engine checks that semantic runtime objects satisfy the declared constraints and contract predicates.

Responsibilities:

* validate per-argument constraints after coercion
* validate cross-argument preconditions before native calls
* validate return-value postconditions after native calls
* validate object invariants after mutating methods
* produce structured errors with the failing parameter, expected condition, observed value, and coercion trace

Example validation error:

```text
ValidationError in solve(A, b)
  parameter: A
  failed: ORDER_F
  observed: order='C', shape=(10, 10), dtype=float64
  hint: declare From(np.ndarray, copy=True) or pass np.asfortranarray(A)
```

The validation engine is runtime-oriented. It does not replace static typing; it protects the native ABI boundary and provides clear diagnostics for dynamic Python inputs.

---

## Runtime Validation Contracts

Runtime validation contracts are reusable groups of validation rules that describe the semantic obligations of an API.

Contracts may include:

* preconditions: requirements before a native call
* postconditions: guarantees after a native call
* invariants: requirements that must remain true for an object over its lifetime
* aliasing rules: whether inputs may overlap in memory
* mutation rules: which arguments may be modified
* ownership rules: whether returned objects borrow, own, or view native memory

Example:

```python
@contract(
    pre=[
        lambda ctx: ctx.args.A.shape == (ctx.args.N, ctx.args.N),
        lambda ctx: ctx.args.b.shape == (ctx.args.N,),
        lambda ctx: ctx.args.A.device == ctx.args.b.device == 'cpu',
    ],
    post=[
        lambda ctx: ctx.result.shape == (ctx.args.N,),
        lambda ctx: ctx.result.dtype == "float64",
    ],
    invariants=[
        lambda ctx: not ctx.result.aliases(ctx.args.A)",
    ],
)
def solve(
    A: Float64Matrix[From(np.ndarray), CPUResident],
    b: Float64Vector[From(np.ndarray), CPUResident],
) -> Float64Vector: ...
```

Contracts are higher-level than constraints. A constraint can say `b` has shape `N`; a contract can say `A` and `b` agree on the same `N` and that the returned vector does not alias mutable input storage.

---

## Important Concept Separation

The architecture separates:

| Concept | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Semantic type | what the object is |
| Coercion | how another type becomes it |
| Constraint | local requirements on an adapted value |
| Validation contract | API-level preconditions, postconditions, invariants, and aliasing rules |
| Backend adapter | semantic object → ABI representation |

This separation is fundamental.

---

## Runtime Coercion Registry

Allowed coercions declared in `.pyi` are implemented through a runtime coercion registry in the equivalent `.py` file.

Example:

```python
@coercion(np.ndarray, Float64Matrix, implicit=True, cost=1, zero_copy="if_compatible")
def ndarray_to_matrix(A: np.ndarray) -> Float64MatrixObject:
    return Float64MatrixObject.from_numpy(A)
```

This registers:

```text
np.ndarray -> Float64Matrix
```

inside the runtime registry.

---

## Runtime Contract Registry

Validation contracts can also be registered and reused by name.

Example:

```python
@validation_contract
def square_linear_system(ctx):
    A = ctx.arg("A")
    b = ctx.arg("b")
    result = ctx.result

    ctx.require(A.ndim == 2, "A must be a matrix")
    ctx.require(A.shape[0] == A.shape[1], "A must be square")
    ctx.require(b.shape == (A.shape[0],), "b must match A rows")
    ctx.ensure(result.shape == b.shape, "solution shape must match b")
```

The interface can then reference the contract:

```python
@contract(square_linear_system)
def solve(A: Float64Matrix, b: Float64Vector) -> Float64Vector: ...
```

This allows common validation logic to be shared across Fortran, C, C++, Rust, and CUDA backends.

---

## Runtime Dispatch Flow

Suppose:

```python
x = solve(np.ones((10, 10)), np.ones(10))
```

Runtime pipeline:

```text
Input objects
    ↓
Find semantic target types
    ↓
Find coercion paths
    ↓
Apply coercions
    ↓
Validate argument constraints
    ↓
Validate contract preconditions
    ↓
Backend adapters
    ↓
Native ABI call
    ↓
Validate contract postconditions and invariants
    ↓
Return Python object
```

---

## Coercion Graphs

The runtime should support composed coercions.

Example:

```text
TorchTensor
    ↓
np.ndarray
    ↓
Float64Matrix
```

The runtime can automatically infer:

```text
TorchTensor -> Float64Matrix
```

through graph traversal when the path is declared safe and allowed for the target API.

---

## Coercion Metadata

Coercions may contain metadata.

Example:

```python
@coercion(
    np.ndarray,
    Float64Matrix,
    implicit=True,
    cost=1,
    zero_copy=True,
    preserves_aliasing=True,
)
def ndarray_to_matrix(A):
    ...
```

Possible metadata:

* implicit/explicit
* safe/unsafe
* cost
* zero-copy
* ownership
* device awareness
* aliasing behavior
* mutability preservation

---

## Semantic Runtime Objects

The runtime should internally use semantic runtime objects.

Example:

```python
class Float64MatrixObject:
    ptr: int
    shape: tuple[int, int]
    strides: tuple[int, int]
    owner: object | None
    device: str
    writable: bool
    aliases: set[int]
```

These objects are:

* language-independent
* runtime-oriented
* semantic representations

NOT:

* NumPy arrays
* Fortran descriptors
* Eigen matrices

---

## Backend Adapters

Backend adapters convert:

```text
Semantic runtime object
    ↓
Native ABI representation
```

Examples:

* Fortran descriptors
* Eigen maps
* C structs
* CUDA tensors

Adapters should receive values only after coercion and validation have completed. This keeps ABI code focused on call mechanics instead of user-input cleanup.

---

## Wrapping Libraries Without Source Code

The framework should support wrapping:

* `.so`
* `.dll`
* static libraries

without source code.

Users provide:

* semantic `.pyi`
* coercions if needed
* validation contracts if needed
* optional metadata

No source parsing required.

---

## Optional Parser Frontends

Parsers are helpers.

NOT the foundation.

Possible parsers:

* Fortran parser
* C parser
* C++ parser
* Rust parser

Their role:

* generate starter `.pyi`
* synchronize declarations
* help users bootstrap wrappers

The semantic interface remains canonical.

---

## Mixed-Language Libraries

The framework should support libraries implemented in multiple languages simultaneously.

Example:

* Fortran numerical kernels
* C runtime layer
* C++ object systems
* Rust runtime safety
* CUDA kernels

All unified through:

* semantic types
* coercions
* constraints
* validation contracts
* backend adapters

---

## Example Mixed-Language Workflow

Suppose:

### Fortran solver

```fortran
subroutine solve_system(A, b, x)
```

### C++ mesh

```cpp
class Mesh {
public:
    void refine();
};
```

### Rust optimizer

```rust
extern "C" fn optimize(ptr: *mut f64, len: usize) -> i32;
```

The semantic API may expose:

```python
class Solver:
    @contract(pre=square_linear_system)
    def solve(
        self,
        A: Float64Matrix[From(np.ndarray), ORDER_F],
        b: Float64Vector[From(np.ndarray)],
    ) -> Float64Vector: ...

class Mesh:
    @contract(post=[lambda ctx:ctx.self.is_valid()])
    def refine(self) -> None: ...

def optimize(
    x: Float64Vector[From(np.ndarray), Writable, CPUResident],
) -> OptimizationResult: ...
```

The user does not care about implementation language. The semantic layer records type meaning, conversion policy, validation policy, and backend dispatch.

---

## Ownership and Lifetime Management

The runtime must manage:

* borrowed references
* owned references
* zero-copy views
* temporary coercions
* destruction policies
* aliasing constraints
* mutation contracts

This is one of the hardest parts of the system.

---

## Zero-Copy Interoperability

The runtime should avoid unnecessary copies whenever possible.

Examples:

| Conversion | Strategy |
| --- | --- |
| NumPy F-order → Fortran | zero-copy |
| NumPy C-order → Fortran descriptor requiring F-order | copy or reject, depending on contract |
| NumPy → Eigen::Map | zero-copy when dtype, alignment, and strides match |
| Torch CUDA → CPU array | copy, unless API accepts GPU memory |
| CuPy array → CUDA kernel | zero-copy when stream and device contracts match |

The runtime should optimize coercion paths automatically while still honoring explicit API contracts.

---

## Scientific Computing Focus

The architecture is especially useful for:

* HPC
* FEM
* CFD
* climate models
* tensor runtimes
* numerical libraries
* GPU computing
* scientific Python ecosystems

because these domains already contain:

* mixed-language systems
* difficult interoperability
* legacy Fortran/C++ code
* array-heavy APIs
* strict shape, device, ownership, and aliasing requirements

---

## CPython Extension Backend

The project should generate custom CPython extensions directly.

Reasons:

* full control over runtime
* full control over arrays
* full control over coercions
* full control over validation contracts
* better diagnostics
* better ownership handling
* better performance

The project should NOT fundamentally depend on:

* SWIG
* ctypes
* pybind11

although optional backends may exist later.

---

## Diagnostics

Diagnostics are extremely important.

The framework should provide:

* clear coercion errors
* constraint validation errors
* contract validation errors
* coercion trace visualization
* ownership diagnostics
* backend dispatch diagnostics

Example diagnostic:

```text
ContractError in Solver.solve(A, b)
  contract: square_linear_system
  failed: b.shape == (A.shape[0],)
  observed:
    A.shape = (10, 10)
    b.shape = (8,)
  coercion trace:
    A: np.ndarray -> Float64Matrix [zero-copy]
    b: np.ndarray -> Float64Vector [zero-copy]
```

This should be much better than typical SWIG/f2py errors.

---

## Plugin Ecosystem

Third-party ecosystems should be able to register:

* semantic types
* coercions
* constraints
* validation contracts
* backend adapters

This allows:

* NumPy support
* Torch support
* JAX support
* CUDA support
* sparse matrix ecosystems
* domain-specific runtimes

---

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Semantic API and IR

* Define the `.pyi`-style semantic grammar.
* Represent semantic types, argument mappings, ownership rules, constraints, and validation contracts in the IR.
* Generate a minimal Python-facing wrapper skeleton from the IR.

### Phase 2: Runtime Coercion Engine

* Implement the coercion registry.
* Support direct coercions, composed coercion paths, cost ranking, and zero-copy metadata.
* Add structured coercion traces for diagnostics.

### Phase 3: Runtime Validation Engine

* Implement local constraint validation for shape, dtype, contiguity, device, mutability, ownership, and alignment.
* Attach validation failures to source parameters and semantic declarations.
* Run validation after coercion and before backend adaptation.

### Phase 4: Runtime Validation Contracts

* Add reusable contract declarations for preconditions, postconditions, invariants, aliasing, mutation, and ownership.
* Support named contract registration and inline contracts in the semantic interface.
* Validate cross-argument relationships such as matching dimensions, shared devices, non-overlapping buffers, and stable object invariants.
* Include contract traces in diagnostics.

### Phase 5: Backend Adapters

* Implement initial Fortran and C adapters.
* Add C++ and Rust adapters after the semantic runtime is stable.
* Add CUDA/device-memory adapters once device contracts are available.

### Phase 6: Parser Frontends and Ecosystem Plugins

* Add optional parser frontends that generate starter semantic interfaces.
* Add plugin APIs for NumPy, Torch, JAX, CUDA, and sparse matrix ecosystems.
* Keep parser output editable and subordinate to the canonical semantic interface.

---

## Long-Term Goal

The final system becomes:

* a semantic wrapper compiler
* a runtime interoperability framework
* a mixed-language scientific runtime layer
* a semantic coercion engine
* a runtime validation engine
* a runtime validation contract system
* a modern replacement for old wrapper systems

The key innovation is:

```text
Semantic interoperability
instead of
parser-centric wrapper generation
```

---
