# Developer Guide

This guide is for changing x2py. It maps user-visible behavior to its owning
implementation and tests, then gives focused change and verification
workflows.

Use the [tutorial](tutorial.md) and [examples cookbook](examples.md) to inspect
the public workflows before changing them. This guide is the maintainer entry
point for the C and Fortran parser references, implementation ownership, and
the detailed maintained contracts.

## Start Here

Install the project and QA dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -e ".[qa]"
```

Run the smallest relevant test while iterating, then run the full suite:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python3 -m pytest -q tests/parser/test_cli.py
PYTHONPATH=. python3 -m pytest -q
```

Before changing a public behavior, trace it through these layers:

```text
public command or Python API
  -> owning parser or CLI entrypoint
  -> parser model
  -> semantic conversion, when applicable
  -> .pyi printer/loader, when applicable
  -> readiness, when applicable
  -> focused tests and maintained reference docs
```

For example, a new CLI stage option normally requires:

1. A focused contract test in `tests/parser/test_cli.py`.
2. Dispatch or output routing in `x2py/cli.py`.
3. Preprocessing tests if the option changes source loading.
4. A copy-paste command in [examples.md](examples.md).
5. A tutorial update only when the main user workflow changes.

## Support Evidence Rule

Documentation must describe implemented behavior, not intended behavior.
Treat a support claim as established only when it is traceable to current
implementation plus one of these forms of evidence:

- a focused test that proves the contract;
- a maintained fixture test that proves generated output;
- a repository command that has been run against a checked fixture;
- an explicit parser or semantic reference inventory backed by tests.

Use these documentation roles consistently:

| Document | Role |
| --- | --- |
| [tutorial.md](tutorial.md) | Main supported user workflow and boundaries |
| [examples.md](examples.md) | Copy-paste commands and Python API recipes |
| [c_parser.md](c_parser.md) | Maintainer inventory for the C frontend |
| [fortran_parser.md](fortran_parser.md) | Maintainer inventory for the Fortran frontend |
| [semantics.md](semantics.md) | Accepted semantic IR and datatype contract |
| [pyi_format.md](pyi_format.md) | User-visible semantic `.pyi` syntax and roadmap |
| [wrapper_design_notes.md](wrapper_design_notes.md) | Clearly deferred wrapper policy, not current runtime support |

When adding a user example:

1. Prefer a checked repository fixture or a short inline source string.
2. Run the command or snippet from the repository root.
3. Add or identify the focused test that owns the behavior.
4. State limitations next to the example when metadata is preserved but not
   executed, such as `@native_call` projection metadata.
5. Do not describe future wrapper generation as implemented support.

### Automatically Verify Markdown Examples

`tests/tools/test_documentation_examples.py` executes explicitly marked
`bash` CLI examples and `python` API snippets from `README.md` and Markdown
files under `docs/`. Bash examples must be `python3 -m x2py` or
`python3 -m x2py.type_mapping_report` commands; the test replaces `python3`
with the active test interpreter and runs them without a shell. It rejects
shell operators, output-writing options, and options that select custom
executables or preprocessing command templates. Python snippets run with the
active test interpreter.

Mark a command that only needs to exit successfully:

````markdown
<!-- x2py-doc-test: run -->
```bash
python3 -m x2py tests/data/fortran/general/basic_subroutine.f90 --semantics
```
````

Mark a command whose stdout must match the documentation exactly:

````markdown
<!-- x2py-doc-test: exact -->
```bash
python3 -m x2py tests/data/fortran/general/basic_subroutine.f90 --parse
```

<!-- x2py-doc-test-output -->
```text
File: tests/data/fortran/general/basic_subroutine.f90
...
```
````

Use exact checks for stable human-readable output. Use run checks for large
JSON or semantic payloads whose detailed contract is already covered by
focused tests. The same markers can precede a `python` fenced block. Do not
mark placeholder commands, snippets that modify the checkout,
environment-dependent compiler recipes, or intentionally failing diagnostic
examples.

When a command reads a checked fixture, include its source input in the user
documentation and verify the displayed source against the fixture:

````markdown
<!-- x2py-doc-source: tests/data/fortran/general/basic_subroutine.f90 -->
```fortran
module m1
...
end module m1
```
````

Append a target profile to an exact marker only for compiler-generated output
that is intentionally architecture-specific:

```markdown
<!-- x2py-doc-test: exact linux-x86_64 -->
```

Off-target checks are skipped. The matching profile must still run the command
and compare its complete output.

Run the documentation checks directly:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python3 -m pytest -q tests/tools/test_documentation_examples.py
```

## User-Facing Contract Internals

The tutorial, examples cookbook, `.pyi` format, and semantic reference describe
CLI stages, `.pyi` syntax, datatype names, and readiness reports. The developer
task is to keep those user-visible contracts stable, tested, and traceable to
implementation files.

### `.pyi` Contract Internals

User-visible `.pyi` syntax is parsed by `x2py/semantics/pyi_parser.py` and printed
by `x2py/codegen/printers/pyi_printer.py`. Both operate on `x2py/semantics/models.py`.

Important implementation rules:

- `Ptr(T)` and `Ptr(Const(T))` are storage contracts, not just pretty syntax.
- Array subscriptions such as `Float64[n]` are semantic array contracts.
- `Annotated[..., ORDER_F]`, `ORDER_ANY`, `Allocatable`, `Pointer`, and
  `Intent("out")` are metadata on the semantic storage contract.
- `Final[T]` is the public constant spelling. Do not reintroduce
  `Constant` as user-facing `.pyi` syntax.
- `@native_call` is projection metadata. Use it only when the Python-visible
  signature intentionally differs from the native signature.
- Generated stubs should describe exact native contracts unless semantic IR
  explicitly carries projection metadata.

When changing `.pyi` syntax:

1. Add or update parser tests in `tests/pyi/test_pyi_to_ir.py`.
2. Add or update printer tests in `tests/semantics/test_pyi_printer.py`.
3. Update fixture tests only if the public generated contract changes.
4. Update [tutorial.md](tutorial.md) or [examples.md](examples.md) if users
   need to write or read the new syntax.
5. Update [pyi_format.md](pyi_format.md) for the full user-facing reference.
6. Update [semantics.md](semantics.md) if the underlying semantic IR contract
   changes.

### Datatype Mapping Internals

User-visible datatype names are semantic names, not raw parser spellings.
Mapping happens during parser-to-IR conversion:

- Fortran intrinsic/kind mapping and compiler storage-fact application live in
  `x2py/semantics/fortran2ir.py`.
- C primitive, typedef, and probe-aware mapping lives in `x2py/semantics/c2ir.py`.
- The shared dtype names and storage contracts live in `x2py/semantics/models.py`.
- Compiler-measured mapping snapshots are generated by
  `x2py/type_mapping_report.py`.

When changing datatype mapping:

1. Add focused conversion tests in `tests/semantics/test_fortran2ir.py` or
   `tests/semantics/test_c2ir.py`.
2. Add `.pyi` printer/loader coverage if the emitted syntax changes.
3. Update semantic fixtures only when serialized semantic IR intentionally
   changes.
4. Update [semantics.md](semantics.md), plus
   [tutorial.md](tutorial.md) or [examples.md](examples.md) when the visible
   user workflow or examples change.
5. Regenerate and update the exact target mapping snapshots in
   [semantics.md](semantics.md). The executable documentation test must match
   the complete output of:

   ```bash
   python3 -m x2py.type_mapping_report --language c
   python3 -m x2py.type_mapping_report --language fortran
   ```

For Fortran, keep both modern and legacy spellings in the generated report.
Legacy numeric `type*N` forms carry fixed total storage; compiler-dependent
default, kind, `DOUBLE PRECISION`, and `DOUBLE COMPLEX` forms use probe facts.

### Readiness Internals

Readiness is semantic-layer behavior. Parser models should record facts and
diagnostics, but the final `wrappable` answer belongs to
`x2py/semantics/readiness.py`.

When adding a readiness blocker:

1. Attach parser-to-IR metadata in `x2py/semantics/fortran2ir.py` or
   `x2py/semantics/c2ir.py`.
2. Normalize/report it in `x2py/semantics/readiness.py`.
3. Add focused tests in `tests/semantics/test_semantic_wrap_readiness.py` or
   `tests/semantics/test_c_semantic_readiness.py`.
4. Update readiness fixtures only if user-visible messages intentionally
   change.
5. Update [tutorial.md](tutorial.md) or [examples.md](examples.md) when the
   blocker is something users can fix by editing `.pyi`.

### Parser To Wrapper Boundary

Do not move wrapper policy into parsers. Parsers can preserve:

- source locations;
- declaration and signature facts;
- type, pointer, array, callback, and aggregate facts;
- preprocessor provenance and diagnostics;
- unresolved references.

Wrappers and semantic readiness decide:

- ownership and lifetime;
- callback registration/unregistration policy;
- output-buffer projection;
- hidden pointer/size projection;
- ABI shim requirements;
- Python-visible signature adaptation.

## Pipeline Internals

The user-facing stages all start in `x2py/cli.py`, but each stage owns a
different layer of the pipeline.

```text
CLI args
  -> language resolution
  -> preprocessing config and source loading
  -> parser models
  -> semantic IR
  -> .pyi printing / .pyi loading
  -> readiness report
```

### CLI And Language Resolution

`x2py/cli.py` is the shared command-line entrypoint. It is responsible for:

- choosing Fortran or C from `--language` and file suffixes;
- rejecting ambiguous directories and unknown suffixes without `--language`;
- building `PreprocessingConfig`;
- dispatching the requested stage flags;
- routing text, JSON, and `--out` output.

Recognizable Fortran files and `.pyi` readiness inputs can omit `--language`.
C files and directories require explicit language selection. Keep this behavior
tested in `tests/parser/test_cli.py` whenever stage selection changes.

The package-specific `x2py/fortran_parser/cli.py` remains for the Fortran parser
package entrypoint. New cross-language user behavior normally belongs in
`x2py/cli.py`.

### Preprocessing Internals

`x2py/preprocessing.py` owns compiler-backed preprocessing and provenance. The
main value object is `PreprocessingConfig`; the main execution path is
`run_compiler_preprocessor_with_recipe(...)`.

Important contracts:

- CLI source parsing uses compiler mode. C defaults to `cc`; Fortran defaults
  to `gfortran` unless the user passes a compiler, compile database, or custom
  template.
- C direct parser entrypoints can still be used on raw strings or already
  controlled source in Python tests.
- The preprocessing recipe is part of the parser payload when preprocessing
  happened. It records compiler, adapter, argv, include directories, defines,
  undefs, standard, extra compiler args, included files, source mappings, and
  diagnostics.
- C preprocessing uses GCC/Clang-style `-E -x c` for direct compiler mode.
  Fortran direct compiler mode uses `-E -cpp` plus source-form hints where
  needed.
- Native Fortran `include "..."` is expanded after compiler CPP output because
  it is Fortran textual inclusion, not C/CPP include semantics.

When changing preprocessing behavior, update
`tests/parser/test_preprocessing_cli.py`, source-boundary tests in
`tests/parser/test_preprocessor_and_execution_boundaries.py`, and C raw
directive tests in `tests/parser/c/test_c_lexer_preprocessor.py`.

### Source Loading To Semantic IR Paths

Keep source loading, parser models, and semantic conversion separate. Semantic
converters accept parsed models; they must not hide compiler preprocessing or
source loading inside conversion helpers.

Fortran direct Python API, no CPP/FPP macros:

```python
from x2py import parse_fortran_file
from semantics.fortran2ir import fortran_module_to_semantic_module

parsed = parse_fortran_file(source, filename="visibility_mod.f90")
semantic = fortran_module_to_semantic_module(parsed.modules[0])
```

`parse_fortran_file(...)` runs the parser's internal line preparation:
source-form detection, comment stripping, and continuation folding. It does
not expand `#define`, `#ifdef`, or other CPP/FPP directives. Raw CPP/FPP
directives are rejected with `PARSE_PREPROCESSING_REQUIRED`.

Fortran with macros or textual configuration must be compiler-preprocessed
before parsing:

```python
from pathlib import Path

from x2py import parse_fortran_file
from semantics.fortran2ir import fortran_file_to_semantic_modules
from x2py.preprocessing import PreprocessingConfig, preprocess_source

path = Path("configured.F90")
preprocessed = preprocess_source(
    path,
    language="fortran",
    config=PreprocessingConfig(
        mode="compiler",
        compiler="gfortran",
        defines=["USE_MPI", "N=32"],
        include_dirs=["include"],
    ),
)

parsed = parse_fortran_file(preprocessed.source, filename=str(path))
modules = fortran_file_to_semantic_modules(parsed)
```

Choose the Fortran semantic helper from the parser model shape:

- `fortran_module_to_semantic_module(parsed.modules[0])` for one selected
  module.
- `[fortran_module_to_semantic_module(m) for m in parsed.modules]` when a file
  contains multiple modules and no top-level standalone procedures matter.
- `fortran_file_to_semantic_modules(parsed, standalone_module_name=...)` when
  top-level procedures should become a synthetic semantic module too.
- `fortran_project_to_semantic_modules(project)` when project-level module and
  derived-type context matters.

Fortran `parameter` values and kind expressions are not CPP macros. If the
parser leaves a Fortran compile-time expression symbolic, collect missing
values with `collect_semantic_compile_time_requirements(parsed)`, evaluate
them with the target compiler or a reusable type report, and pass
`compile_time_values=...` to the semantic converter. The shared CLI semantic
stage performs this target probing when a Fortran compiler or report is
configured; direct API callers must do it explicitly.

C direct Python API, no macro expansion needed:

```python
from x2py import parse_c_file
from semantics.c2ir import c_file_to_semantic_modules

parsed = parse_c_file("int add(int a, int b);", filename="api.h")
modules = c_file_to_semantic_modules(parsed)
```

C raw mode records include and pragma metadata and accepts simple include
guards. Macro-shaped directives such as `#if`, `#ifdef`, `#define` outside a
trivial include guard, and `#error` require compiler preprocessing and are
rejected with `CPARSE_PREPROCESSING_REQUIRED`.

C with macros follows the compiler-preprocessed path, then parses the expanded
translation unit in `compiler` or `preprocessed` mode:

```python
from pathlib import Path

from c_parser.cli import attach_preprocessing_recipe
from x2py import parse_c_file
from semantics.c2ir import c_file_to_semantic_modules
from x2py.preprocessing import PreprocessingConfig, preprocess_source

path = Path("api.h")
preprocessed = preprocess_source(
    path,
    language="c",
    config=PreprocessingConfig(
        mode="compiler",
        compiler="cc",
        defines=["API_EXPORT="],
        include_dirs=["include"],
    ),
)

parsed = parse_c_file(
    preprocessed.source,
    filename=str(path),
    preprocessing="compiler",
)
attach_preprocessing_recipe(parsed, preprocessed.recipe)
modules = c_file_to_semantic_modules(parsed)
```

The C semantic converter can turn recorded object-like numeric macros into
semantic constant variables. Function-like macros and untyped macro bodies are
not wrapper-callable declarations. Declarations that depend on macros which
were recorded but not expanded are surfaced as semantic readiness blockers
rather than treated as complete wrapper contracts.

For CLI code, do not reimplement these paths manually. `x2py/cli.py` builds
the `PreprocessingConfig`, loads or preprocesses source, attaches C
preprocessing recipes, parses, runs target type probes when configured, and
then dispatches to the semantic helpers.

### Semantic, `.pyi`, Readiness, And Type-Probe Paths

The semantic stages share one rule: source inputs become semantic IR before
anything emits `.pyi` or reports readiness. Edited `.pyi` inputs are already a
semantic contract and do not go back through C or Fortran parsing.

Input shapes are part of the contract:

- `parse_fortran_file(source_or_path, filename=...)` accepts inline source
  text. It reads from disk only when `source_or_path` names an existing file
  and `filename` is omitted. Pass `filename` with inline text for diagnostic
  provenance.
- `parse_c_file(source_or_path, filename=...)` accepts inline source text or
  an existing file path. Existing paths are read from disk; `filename` can
  still override the diagnostic/source name.
- `parse_fortran_project(...)` and `parse_c_project(...)` accept an in-memory
  mapping of `filename -> source`, an explicit file/path list, or a directory.
  Fortran directory parsing discovers supported Fortran files and orders them
  by module dependencies. C directory parsing discovers supported C files and
  records include graph facts; include directives do not recursively open more
  files.
- `preprocess_source(path, language=..., config=...)` is path-based because it
  shells out to a compiler. Feed `preprocessed.source` to the parser afterward.
- `parse_pyi_text(...)` and `convert_pyi_to_ir(...)` accept inline `.pyi`
  source text. `load_pyi_file(...)` reads one `.pyi` file, and
  `load_pyi_modules(...)` reads a file set or directory.
- The CLI accepts source, `.pyi`, and directory paths. It does not accept
  inline source text on the command line.

CLI source stages:

```text
source path(s)
  -> x2py/cli.py language resolution
  -> PreprocessingConfig
  -> raw source or compiler-preprocessed source
  -> CFile / FortranFile parser model
  -> C or Fortran semantic IR
  -> optional .pyi emission
  -> optional semantic readiness report
```

CLI `.pyi` readiness:

```text
.pyi path(s) or directory
  -> load_pyi_modules(...)
  -> SemanticModule list
  -> assess_semantic_wrap_readiness(...)
```

Generating `.pyi` from source is semantic conversion plus printing. In Python
API code, keep those calls visible:

```python
from x2py import emit_module_stubs, parse_fortran_file
from semantics.fortran2ir import fortran_file_to_semantic_modules

parsed = parse_fortran_file(source, filename="api.f90")
modules = fortran_file_to_semantic_modules(parsed)
stubs = emit_module_stubs(modules)
```

For C, the same shape uses `parse_c_file(...)` or `parse_c_project(...)`,
then `c_file_to_semantic_modules(...)` or
`c_project_to_semantic_modules(...)`, then `emit_module_stubs(...)`.

Loading or editing `.pyi` is the opposite direction:

```python
from x2py import assess_semantic_wrap_readiness, load_pyi_modules

modules = load_pyi_modules("interfaces")
report = assess_semantic_wrap_readiness(modules, source="interfaces")
```

Use the `.pyi` helpers by input shape:

- `parse_pyi_text(source, module_name=...)` for inline text.
- `convert_pyi_to_ir(source, module_name=...)` as the compatibility alias for
  inline text.
- `load_pyi_file(path, module_name=...)` for one file.
- `load_pyi_modules(paths_or_directory)` for a set of interfaces that may
  reference each other.

Do not run compiler preprocessing, C ABI probes, or Fortran type probes for an
edited `.pyi` readiness check. Once `.pyi` has been loaded, the edited semantic
IR is the source of truth.

Compiler preprocessing flags all flow through `PreprocessingConfig`:

| CLI flag | `PreprocessingConfig` field | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--compiler` | `compiler` | Exact executable for direct preprocessing and automatic type probes. |
| `--compile-commands` | `compile_commands` | Project compile database; automatic C ABI probing is not allowed from this mixed recipe. |
| `--preprocessor-adapter` | `adapter` | Adapter family, including `command-template`. |
| `--preprocess-template` | `command_template` | Custom command; requires `--preprocessor-adapter command-template`. |
| `-I` / `--include-dir` | `include_dirs` | Passed to compiler preprocessing and native Fortran include expansion. |
| `-D` / `--define` | `defines` | Macro definitions for compiler preprocessing. |
| `-U` / `--undef` | `undefs` | Macro undefinitions for compiler preprocessing. |
| `--std` | `std` | Passed as `-std=...`. |
| `--compiler-arg` | `compiler_args` | Raw target/sysroot/compiler options. |
| `--public-include`, `--private-include`, `--include-exposure` | include exposure fields | Controls provenance exposure, not parser grammar. |

`preprocess_source(...)` returns expanded source and a recipe. The C parser
needs `preprocessing="compiler"` or `"preprocessed"` for that expanded source,
and CLI code attaches the recipe with `attach_preprocessing_recipe(...)` so
macro metadata can reach semantic conversion. Fortran consumes the expanded
source with `parse_fortran_file(...)`; the parse-stage CLI payload records the
recipe separately.

C target datatype mapping path:

```text
C source
  -> parse_c_project(...)
  -> optional C standard type report
  -> c_project_to_semantic_modules(..., standard_type_report=...)
```

For direct-compiler C semantic, `.pyi`, and readiness stages, `x2py/cli.py`
loads `--c-type-report` when supplied. Otherwise, when a direct compiler is
configured, it runs `probe_c_standard_types_cached(...)` and passes the report
to `x2py/semantics/c2ir.py`. Compile databases and custom preprocessing templates
must use an explicit reusable `--c-type-report` because a single automatic ABI
probe cannot represent every per-file recipe in those modes. Probe runner,
cache directory, and refresh flags belong to `x2py/c_type_probe.py`.

Fortran target datatype mapping and compile-time path:

```text
Fortran source
  -> parse_fortran_file(...)
  -> collect_semantic_compile_time_requirements(...)
  -> evaluate_fortran_type_requirements(...)
  -> collect_fortran_type_storage_requirements(...)
  -> evaluate_fortran_type_facts(...)
  -> fortran_module_to_semantic_module(..., compile_time_values=..., type_facts=...)
```

The CLI performs those probe steps for Fortran semantic, `.pyi`, and readiness
stages when a direct Fortran compiler or `--fortran-type-report` is configured.
`compile_time_values` resolve symbolic parameters and kind expressions.
`type_facts` measure compiler-dependent intrinsic storage, such as default
integer width or target-changing flags. Compile databases and custom
preprocessing templates should use an explicit reusable
`--fortran-type-report` for the same reason as C.

Generated datatype mapping reports are documentation and verification outputs,
not a separate parse path. `x2py/type_mapping_report.py` uses the C and Fortran
converter/probe machinery to print target-specific mapping examples for
`docs/semantics.md`; changes there need both semantic conversion tests and
documentation-example verification.

### Parser Model Internals

Parser models are source facts. They should answer "what did the source say?"
rather than "what Python wrapper should be generated?"

Fortran:

- `x2py/fortran_parser/parser.py` slices the file into grammar units, then parses
  each unit's specification region.
- `x2py/fortran_parser/models.py` stores `FortranFile`, modules, procedures,
  variables, derived types, interfaces, programs, submodules, and diagnostics.
- Execution bodies are intentionally skipped after the parser has enough
  signature/source facts.

C:

- `x2py/c_parser/lexer.py` handles comments, directives, top-level splitting, and
  token source locations.
- `x2py/c_parser/parser.py` visits declarations and declarators, records typed
  source facts, and reports unsupported parser-owned syntax.
- `x2py/c_parser/models.py` stores functions, variables, typedefs, structs, unions,
  enums, includes, raw directives, preprocessing facts, and diagnostics.

Adding parser fields is a schema decision. Add fields only when downstream
semantic conversion, fixtures, diagnostics, or user-visible behavior need a
new fact.

### Semantic IR Internals

The semantic layer normalizes C and Fortran facts into language-neutral models
from `x2py/semantics/models.py`.

- `x2py/semantics/fortran2ir.py` maps Fortran procedures, derived types, module
  variables, kinds, shapes, storage contracts, visibility, imported references,
  and compile-time values.
- `x2py/semantics/c2ir.py` maps C functions, variables, structs/opaque structs,
  enums, typedef chains, standard-type probe facts, macros, pointer/array
  storage, and C-specific readiness blockers.
- C `int` keeps the semantic name `Int` while its compiler-probed concrete
  precision is stored on the semantic type. C and Fortran enums lower to
  unscoped module-level integer constants; enum names are metadata, not
  semantic datatypes.
- Named data bindings share a common base but keep role-specific types:
  `SemanticVariable` for module/global variables and macro constants,
  `SemanticArgument` for callable parameters, `SemanticField` for struct,
  union, and Fortran derived-type fields. `SemanticFunction.locals` is the
  reserved home for local variables or local constants if a frontend later
  promotes them into semantic IR; local bindings are not emitted into `.pyi` or
  treated as wrapper interface items by default.
- `x2py/codegen/printers/pyi_printer.py` emits editable user contracts.
- `x2py/semantics/pyi_parser.py` loads edited contracts back into semantic IR.
- `x2py/semantics/readiness.py` decides whether that IR is complete enough for
  wrapping.

Keep semantic IR stable where possible. If a parser change does not affect the
semantic contract, avoid changing semantic fixtures.

### `.pyi` Projection Internals

`@native_call` is stored as projection metadata on `SemanticFunction`. The
loader and printer currently support `Arg`, `Return`, `Const`, `Len`,
`IsPresent`, `Work`, and `.shape[...]` value references. They do not currently
implement future wrapper projection helpers such as `Ptr(Arg(...))`, `As[...]`,
status-return policy, ownership conversion, or coercion execution.

The test ownership is:

- loader syntax and error behavior: `tests/pyi/test_pyi_to_ir.py`;
- printer round-trip shape: `tests/semantics/test_pyi_printer.py`;
- readiness interpretation: `tests/semantics/test_semantic_wrap_readiness.py`
  and `tests/semantics/test_c_semantic_readiness.py`.

When adding projection syntax, first add loader tests that prove the accepted
syntax and rejected syntax. Then add printer tests and readiness tests only if
the new metadata affects those layers.

## Testing Strategy

Use the smallest test layer that proves the behavior, then add broader
coverage only when the public contract changes.

### Test Layers

| Layer | Purpose | Typical files |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Focused parser tests | One construct, diagnostic, or model field | `tests/parser/test_*.py`, `tests/parser/c/test_*.py` |
| Parser fixture goldens | Serialized parser contract over curated files | `tests/parser/test_fortran_fixture_suite.py`, `tests/parser/c/test_c_fixture_suite.py` |
| Semantic tests | Parser facts converted to wrapper-neutral IR | `tests/semantics/test_fortran2ir.py`, `tests/semantics/test_c2ir.py` |
| `.pyi` tests | Editable contract loader/printer behavior | `tests/pyi/test_pyi_to_ir.py`, `tests/semantics/test_pyi_printer.py` |
| Readiness tests | User-facing blocker and wrappability decisions | `tests/semantics/test_semantic_wrap_readiness.py`, `tests/semantics/test_c_semantic_readiness.py` |
| CLI tests | User commands, output routing, diagnostics | `tests/parser/test_cli.py`, `tests/parser/test_preprocessing_cli.py` |
| Property/fuzz tests | Broad parser robustness invariants | `tests/property/test_parser_properties.py`, `tests/property/test_semantic_properties.py` |

### Choosing Tests For A Change

- Parser-only source fact: focused parser test first; fixture golden only if
  serialized output changes intentionally.
- CLI flag or output change: CLI test first; update README/user docs if the
  visible command changes.
- New datatype mapping: semantic conversion test plus `.pyi` printer/loader
  tests if emitted syntax changes.
- New `.pyi` syntax: loader test, printer test, readiness test if it resolves
  or creates a blocker.
- New readiness blocker: semantic readiness test and fixture refresh only when
  user-facing messages change.
- Preprocessing behavior: preprocessing CLI tests and at least one parser path
  that consumes the recipe.

### Golden Fixture Rules

Do not regenerate broad fixture sets to hide uncertainty. First write or run a
focused test that explains the intended behavior. Then regenerate only the
affected fixture group when the serialized contract really changed.

Useful commands:

```bash
python tests/parser/c/generate_c_parser_goldens.py tests/data/c/general/math_api.h
python tests/parser/fortran/generate_fortran_parser_goldens.py tests/data/fortran/general/basic_subroutine.f90
python tests/semantics/generate_semantic_fixtures.py
python tests/semantics/generate_wrap_readiness_fixtures.py
python tests/pyi/generate_pyi_fixtures.py
```

### Coverage And CI Parity

When investigating coverage failures, mirror the GitHub Actions coverage flow
instead of relying on a plain local run:

```bash
COVERAGE_PROCESS_START=pyproject.toml PYTHONPATH=. coverage run -m pytest
python -m coverage combine
python -m coverage report
```

The `COVERAGE_PROCESS_START` environment variable matters because subprocess
CLI tests need the same coverage configuration as CI.

## Feature Change Walkthroughs

Use these walkthroughs when adding behavior. They are deliberately procedural:
change the smallest owned layer first, test that layer, then update downstream
contracts only when the public behavior actually changes.

### Add A C Declaration Feature

Example target: support a new declaration spelling or compiler extension in
the C parser.

1. Add the smallest source example to a focused C parser test:
   `tests/parser/c/test_c_declarations_and_declarators.py`,
   `tests/parser/c/test_c_compiler_extensions.py`, or
   `tests/parser/c/test_c_structs_unions_enums_typedefs.py`.
2. Implement the parser change in `x2py/c_parser/parser.py`. Add or update model
   fields in `x2py/c_parser/models.py` only if the serialized parser contract needs
   new facts.
3. If source splitting or raw directive handling changes, update
   `x2py/c_parser/lexer.py` and `tests/parser/c/test_c_lexer_preprocessor.py`.
4. If project-level resolution changes, update
   `tests/parser/c/test_c_project_resolution.py`.
5. If parser JSON changes intentionally, regenerate the relevant project
   golden:

   ```bash
   python tests/parser/c/generate_c_parser_goldens.py tests/data/c/general/math_api.h
   ```

6. If the new parser fact affects semantic conversion, update
   `x2py/semantics/c2ir.py` and add coverage in `tests/semantics/test_c2ir.py`.
7. If the generated `.pyi` changes, update `tests/semantics/test_pyi_printer.py`
   or `tests/pyi/test_pyi_fixture_suite.py`.
8. Update [c_parser.md](c_parser.md), [tutorial.md](tutorial.md),
   [examples.md](examples.md), or [semantics.md](semantics.md) if users or
   maintainers need to know the new behavior.

Focused verification:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q tests/parser/c/test_c_declarations_and_declarators.py
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q tests/parser/c/test_c_project_resolution.py
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q tests/semantics/test_c2ir.py
```

### Add A Fortran Parser Feature

Example target: preserve a new declaration attribute, source fact, or argument
metadata item.

1. Add a focused parser test in the file that owns the behavior:
   `tests/parser/test_procedure_and_type_parsing.py`,
   `tests/parser/test_scope_handling.py`, or
   `tests/parser/test_preprocessor_and_execution_boundaries.py`.
2. Implement parsing in `x2py/fortran_parser/parser.py`. Add model fields in
   `x2py/fortran_parser/models.py` only if the parser output needs to expose the
   new fact.
3. Add parser diagnostic coverage in `tests/parser/test_error_handling.py` if
   malformed source should now fail differently.
4. If project ordering, imports, or compile-time values change, update
   `tests/parser/test_project_scope_models.py` or
   `tests/parser/test_fortran_type_probe.py`.
5. If serialized parser JSON changes intentionally, regenerate the selected
   fixture:

   ```bash
   python tests/parser/fortran/generate_fortran_parser_goldens.py tests/data/fortran/general/basic_subroutine.f90
   ```

6. If the new fact affects semantic output, update `x2py/semantics/fortran2ir.py`
   and `tests/semantics/test_fortran2ir.py`.
7. If generated `.pyi` changes, update `tests/semantics/test_pyi_printer.py`
   and the relevant fixture tests.
8. Update [fortran_parser.md](fortran_parser.md), [tutorial.md](tutorial.md),
   [examples.md](examples.md), or [semantics.md](semantics.md) as needed.

Focused verification:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q tests/parser/test_procedure_and_type_parsing.py
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q tests/parser/test_fortran_fixture_suite.py
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q tests/semantics/test_fortran2ir.py
```

### Add Or Change Datatype Mapping

Example target: map a new Fortran kind, C typedef, or target-probed C type.

1. Add conversion coverage in `tests/semantics/test_fortran2ir.py` or
   `tests/semantics/test_c2ir.py`.
2. Implement the mapping in `x2py/semantics/fortran2ir.py` or `x2py/semantics/c2ir.py`.
3. Keep the public semantic dtype names in `x2py/semantics/models.py` stable unless
   there is a deliberate schema decision.
4. If the emitted `.pyi` annotation changes, update
   `tests/semantics/test_pyi_printer.py` and `tests/pyi/test_pyi_to_ir.py`.
5. Update the datatype tables in [semantics.md](semantics.md), and update
   [tutorial.md](tutorial.md) or [examples.md](examples.md) when a visible
   example changes.

Focused verification:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q tests/semantics/test_fortran2ir.py tests/semantics/test_c2ir.py
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q tests/semantics/test_pyi_printer.py tests/pyi/test_pyi_to_ir.py
```

### Add `.pyi` Syntax Or Projection Behavior

Example target: add a new `Annotated[...]` metadata item or projection helper.

1. Add loader tests in `tests/pyi/test_pyi_to_ir.py`.
2. Update `x2py/semantics/pyi_parser.py`.
3. Add printer tests in `tests/semantics/test_pyi_printer.py`.
4. Update `x2py/codegen/printers/pyi_printer.py`.
5. Update semantic models in `x2py/semantics/models.py` only if the IR needs a new
   field or constraint.
6. Update readiness behavior if the new syntax resolves a blocker.
7. Update [semantics.md](semantics.md), plus [tutorial.md](tutorial.md) or
   [examples.md](examples.md) when users need the new syntax in a workflow.

Focused verification:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q tests/pyi/test_pyi_to_ir.py
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q tests/semantics/test_pyi_printer.py
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q tests/semantics/test_semantic_wrap_readiness.py
```

### Add A Readiness Blocker

Example target: report a new unsupported C/Fortran semantic contract clearly.

1. Preserve the source fact in the parser if it is not already present.
2. Attach semantic blocker metadata in `x2py/semantics/c2ir.py` or
   `x2py/semantics/fortran2ir.py`.
3. Normalize and format the blocker in `x2py/semantics/readiness.py`.
4. Add focused readiness tests in
   `tests/semantics/test_semantic_wrap_readiness.py` or
   `tests/semantics/test_c_semantic_readiness.py`.
5. Regenerate readiness message fixtures only when the public message changes:

   ```bash
   python tests/semantics/generate_wrap_readiness_fixtures.py
   ```

6. Update [tutorial.md](tutorial.md) or [examples.md](examples.md) if users
   can fix the blocker by editing `.pyi`.

Focused verification:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q tests/semantics/test_semantic_wrap_readiness.py
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q tests/semantics/test_c_semantic_readiness.py
```

### Add Or Change CLI Behavior

Example target: add a stage option, change output routing, or improve
diagnostic formatting.

1. Add CLI tests in `tests/parser/test_cli.py` first.
2. Implement shared dispatch and output behavior in `x2py/cli.py`.
3. Keep Fortran package-specific CLI behavior in `x2py/fortran_parser/cli.py`.
4. If compiler preprocessing behavior changes, update `x2py/preprocessing.py`
   and preprocessing tests.
5. Update [tutorial.md](tutorial.md) or [examples.md](examples.md) for
   user-facing commands and this guide for maintainer command maps.

Focused verification:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q tests/parser/test_cli.py
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q tests/parser/test_preprocessing_cli.py
```

## Testing Map

Use this map when changing one part of the project. Each section shows how to
call that part manually, which focused test file to run, and where to look for
more executable examples. Run the broader suite before merging.

### Pre-Merge Checks

Run the full suite from the repository root before merging:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q
```

Run the major suites individually while iterating:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q tests/parser
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q tests/semantics
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q tests/pyi
```

As a project policy, do not merge pull requests unless all checks are green.

### Fixture Maintenance

Refresh all C parser project goldens:

```bash
python tests/parser/c/generate_c_parser_goldens.py
```

Refresh one grouped C fixture project:

```bash
python tests/parser/c/generate_c_parser_goldens.py tests/data/c/general/math_api.h
```

Refresh all Fortran parser goldens:

```bash
python tests/parser/fortran/generate_fortran_parser_goldens.py
```

Refresh one Fortran fixture:

```bash
python tests/parser/fortran/generate_fortran_parser_goldens.py tests/data/fortran/general/basic_subroutine.f90
```

In-test Fortran parser fixture update mode:

```bash
FORTRAN_PARSER_UPDATE_GOLDENS=1 PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q tests/parser --confcutdir=tests/
```

Refresh semantic and `.pyi` fixtures:

```bash
python tests/semantics/generate_semantic_fixtures.py
python tests/semantics/generate_wrap_readiness_fixtures.py
python tests/pyi/generate_pyi_fixtures.py
```

When parser model output changes, include the regenerated parser goldens and a
short explanation in the PR. For `.pyi`, semantic IR, or readiness behavior
changes, update the corresponding fixtures under `tests/pyi/fixtures` or
`tests/semantics/fixtures`.
