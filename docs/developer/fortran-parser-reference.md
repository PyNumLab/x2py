# Fortran parser reference (wrapper-focused subset)

This document defines the currently supported parser subset, expected behavior,
and practical usage from terminal and Python.

## 1) Supported features (comprehensive)

### 1.1 Source forms and preprocessing

- Free-form Fortran: `.f90`, `.f95`, `.f03`, `.f08`
- Fixed-form Fortran: `.f`, `.for`, `.ftn`
- Free/fixed comment stripping
- Continuation handling for both forms

### 1.2 Procedure parsing

- `subroutine` headers
- `function` headers
- Header modifiers: `pure`, `elemental`, `recursive`
- Function `result(...)` parsing (tolerant support for `results(...)`)

### 1.3 Declaration/argument parsing

- Intrinsic types: `integer`, `real`, `complex`, `logical`, `character`
- Kind extraction from declaration specs (`kind=...`)
- Attribute extraction:
  - `intent(in|out|inout)`
  - `optional`
  - `value`
  - `allocatable`
  - `pointer`
  - `target`
- Array extraction:
  - `dimension(...)`
  - variable-level shape syntax (`x(:)`, `x(n)`)

### 1.4 Modules, imports, and project context

- Module discovery
- Module variable extraction
- Shared specification-part parsing for module-like scopes (modules,
  submodules, programs, and block-data units), preserving original line
  numbers while skipping contained procedure bodies where they are not
  wrap-relevant
- `use` extraction at module and procedure scope
- Explicit `use` symbol mappings preserve imported `source` names and local
  `target` names for renamed imports
- Propagation of module-level `use` imports into contained procedures
- Folder/project parsing with dependency-aware ordering
- Cross-file kind constant resolution (e.g., kinds modules)
- Cached compile-time expression resolution for local/module parameters,
  module/program variable shapes, and character lengths

### 1.5 Derived type parsing

- `type :: ... end type` and legacy `type name ... end type` discovery
- Parameterized derived-type headers such as `type :: buffer_type(k, n)`
  and declarations such as `type(buffer_type(real64, 4))`
- Type attributes (e.g., `abstract`)
- Inheritance (`extends(parent)`)
- Field extraction including shape/pointer/allocatable
- Type-bound procedures:
  - `procedure ... :: ...` bindings with attributes (e.g. `pass(self)`, `nopass`)
  - `generic ... :: name => target1, target2`

### 1.6 Parser diagnostics and semantic readiness boundary

- Parser diagnostics report source-level parse errors and unsupported parser
  constructs.
- Parser JSON remains parse-only and does not contain `wrap_readiness`,
  `wrappable`, `unit_blockers`, or other readiness payloads.
- Wrap-readiness is assessed from semantic IR, either after converting parsed
  Fortran source or after loading an edited `.pyi` semantic interface.
- The semantic readiness report owns the final file-level `wrappable` flag and
  blocker messages.

## 2) Public API surface

Supported public API:

- `parse_fortran_file(source_or_path, filename=None, encoding="utf-8") -> FortranFile`
- `parse_fortran_project(files, encoding="utf-8") -> FortranProject`
- `assess_semantic_wrap_readiness(semantic_ir, source=None) -> dict`
- `assess_pyi_wrap_readiness(path_or_paths, encoding="utf-8") -> dict`

## Parser organization notes

`x2py/parsers/fortran/parser.py` is now intentionally organized into clearly labeled
sections and carries embedded implementation guidance. Start with the thin public
wrappers at the bottom, then read the class from top to bottom:

- Regex/constants, parser-wide type aliases, private unit dataclasses, and the
  compile-time resolver
- `FortranParser` internals grouped by domain:
  - public parse entrypoints (`parse_file`, `parse_project`). The supported
    module-level API remains the wrappers listed above.
  - source-unit visitors for files, modules, submodules, programs,
    procedures, interfaces, derived types, and block data
  - recursive source-unit slicing (`header`, specification part, execution
    part, `contains`) with original line numbers preserved on each slice
  - shared declaration parsing for module variables, program/block-data
    variables, procedure arguments/results, and derived-type fields
  - `_helper_*` methods for scoped parsing, expression resolution, same-level
    duplicate checks, and shared specification-part collection
- Thin module-level convenience wrappers that delegate to a shared parser
  instance

Parser methods carry focused docstrings, with examples where a grammar visitor
or lexical helper is easier to understand from a concrete call.

The Fortran parser is now packaged under `x2py.parsers.fortran` rather than a
top-level parser package. The package includes its CLI module, lexer,
JSON-compatible parse models, project parser, type resolver, and utility
helpers. Public callers should use the stable top-level `x2py` parser exports
or `x2py.parsers.fortran` package imports.

## Implementation Inventory And Maintenance

This file is the single maintained Fortran parser reference. It replaces the
older standalone implementation-reference document; parser feature inventory,
testing workflow, and maintenance guard policy live here.

The implementation inventory is maintained across these surfaces:

- `x2py/parsers/fortran/parser.py` owns source slicing, declaration extraction,
  diagnostics, project ordering, dependency resolution, and compile-time
  expression resolution.
- `x2py/parsers/fortran/models.py` owns parse-only dataclasses and JSON-compatible
  parser facts.
- `x2py/semantics/fortran2ir.py` owns conversion from parser facts to semantic IR,
  including kind mapping, compile-time specialization, storage contracts,
  projection metadata, and readiness inputs.
- `tests/parser/` covers parser contracts, source-unit slicing, diagnostics,
  project behavior, and fixture regressions.
- `tests/semantics/` covers semantic conversion, datatype precision mapping,
  readiness, `.pyi` emission, and compile-time specialization.

<!-- X2PY_C_DOCS_START
Parser-related pull requests should update this file when the documented
feature inventory, public API, diagnostics, project behavior, semantic handoff,
or maintenance workflow changes. The parser-reference guard watches C,
Fortran, and semantic `.pyi` references independently. For Fortran, it watches
`x2py/parsers/fortran/`, `tests/parser/fortran/`, `tests/data/fortran/`, and focused
Fortran parser tests directly under `tests/parser/`. It expects
`docs/developer/fortran-parser-reference.md` to change unless the PR is explicitly labeled to skip
the guard.
X2PY_C_DOCS_END -->

`parse_file` is the central orchestration path. It first slices the source into
direct file-level units, then each class visitor parses only its own substring
and recursively slices direct children. This is the key parser design: each
Fortran grammar unit has a header, a specification region, optional execution
region, and optional `contains` region. The differences between modules,
programs, procedures, derived types, interfaces, and block data are expressed
by small visitor decisions and grammar flags rather than separate whole-file
parsing loops.

Nested unit boundaries and placement outside execution regions are checked even
when they are not exported as wrapper metadata. Internal procedures inside a
host procedure's `contains` block are structurally sliced, then their
declarations and bodies are skipped. Once an execution boundary is detected,
procedure bodies and standalone included execution fragments are intentionally
skipped. Procedure-local interface blocks are still visited enough to type
callback dummy arguments and to preserve interface metadata.

### 2.1 Recursive parser sketch

Small input:

```fortran
module m
  integer, parameter :: n = 4
contains
  subroutine scale(x)
    real, intent(inout) :: x(n)
  end subroutine scale
end module m
```

The parser handles it in this order:

1. `parse_file` preprocesses the source and calls `_helper_slice_child_units`
   at file scope. The result is one `ModuleUnit` carrying the module name,
   lines, and source locations.
2. the shared `ClassVisitor._visit` dispatcher selects `_visit_ModuleUnit`.
3. `_visit_ModuleUnit` creates a module `_ParserScope`, calls
   `_helper_split_unit_parts`, and sends only the module specification lines to
   `_parse_specification_part`.
4. `_parse_specification_part` uses the shared declaration backend:
   `_helper_parse_declaration_line` parses `integer, parameter :: n = 4`, then
   `_helper_push_declaration_to_scope` appends the resulting parameter variable
   to `FortranModule.variables`.
5. The module visitor recursively slices direct children from its substring.
   It finds one procedure unit, `scale`, and dispatches it to
   `_visit_ProcedureUnit`.
6. `_visit_ProcedureUnit` creates a procedure `_ParserScope`, splits the
   procedure into header/specification/execution/contains, and visits only the
   specification part. The same declaration backend parses
   `real, intent(inout) :: x(n)` and pushes the metadata into the procedure
   argument symbol table.

Scope is always an explicit argument to the shared helpers. That is the reason
two modules can each define `type :: state` without conflict, while two
same-level `module m` declarations or two same-level contained procedures with
the same name are rejected by `_helper_validate_sibling_units`.

End-name validation is strict for structural units whose names define exported
scope boundaries, such as modules, submodules, programs, interfaces, and
derived types. Procedure end-name mismatches are still tolerated while slicing
third-party sources because some accepted fixture code contains copy/paste
procedure end labels; the procedure is closed by unit kind so parsing can
continue, and duplicate procedure names are validated at the sibling scope.

The only separate specification-line visitors are grammar-specific:
module-like units share `_parse_module_like_spec_line`, procedures use
`_parse_procedure_spec_line` for `implicit`, `external`, `import`, and
local `parameter` handling, and derived types use
`_parse_type_spec_line` for `sequence`, `private`, and type-bound
declaration rules. All three still call the same declaration parser/pusher for
actual declarations.

Most parser organization changes are structural, but behavior, model-schema,
coverage, or fixture changes should be reflected in this reference.

Parameter constants expose both `value` and serialized `symbolic_value` when
available. `value` is reserved for a literal/evaluated result after
compile-time folding. If an initializer cannot be evaluated safely, such as
`selected_real_kind(...)`, `value` is `None` and `symbolic_value` preserves the
original initializer for validation, debugging, downstream diagnostics, and
JSON consumers.

Procedure-local parameters may be folded into argument shapes during procedure
finalization. Module-level and `use`-associated parameters used in procedure
argument shapes are kept symbolic in the signature (`x(n)` remains `["n"]`)
and are treated as valid scope references for readiness checks. Module/program
variable shapes and parameter values can be resolved through the compile-time
resolver when enough information is available.

## Reimplementation Guide For Another Parser

Use the Fortran parser as the reference for any source language with nested
program units, scoped declarations, and a later semantic handoff. The details
are Fortran-specific, but the parser architecture is reusable.

Recommended frontend responsibilities:

- Keep one typed model layer for parse-only facts.
- Keep one parser orchestration class with thin public wrappers.
- Slice source into grammar units before parsing declarations.
- Pass scope explicitly into shared helpers rather than using global mutable
  parser state for symbol resolution.
- Parse only wrapper-relevant specification facts; skip executable bodies once
  they are outside the parser contract.
- Preserve source locations and original line numbers through preprocessing and
  recursive slicing.
- Emit parser diagnostics for malformed source, but leave wrappability policy
  to semantic readiness.

The Fortran data flow is:

```text
source path or source text
  -> compiler/native include preprocessing
  -> FortranParser.parse_file(...)
  -> source-unit slices with original line numbers
  -> scoped specification parsing
  -> FortranFile parser facts
  -> parse_fortran_project(...) dependency ordering and namespace resolution
  -> semantics.fortran2ir conversion
  -> readiness, `.pyi`, and the implemented Fortran wrapper stages
```

The recursive parsing pattern is:

1. Identify direct child units at the current grammar level.
2. Split each child into header, specification part, execution part, and
   `contains` part where that language construct allows them.
3. Parse declarations only from the specification part.
4. Recurse only into direct children that are legal for the current unit kind.
5. Validate sibling names and scope-local duplicate declarations.
6. Finalize procedure arguments/results after local declarations and
   parameters are known.
7. Resolve cross-file or imported compile-time facts only at project or
   semantic-conversion boundaries.

When adding another parser, keep these test layers separate:

- parser unit tests for grammar slicing and declarations;
- parser fixture tests for stable JSON/model output;
- parser error fixture tests for fatal diagnostic contracts;
- project tests for dependency ordering and cross-file resolution;
- CLI tests for frontend selection, stage dispatch, output files, and debug
  behavior;
- semantic conversion tests for parser-to-IR mapping;
- `.pyi` tests for generated and edited interface round trips.

## 3) Terminal usage and expected outputs

### 3.1 Basic CLI invocation

```bash
python -m x2py path/to/file.f90 --parse
```

Recognizable Fortran files can omit `--language`. Directories require explicit
frontend selection:

```bash
python -m x2py path/to/fortran_src --language fortran --parse
```

Fortran directories are recursively scanned for `.f`, `.for`, `.ftn`, `.f90`,
`.f95`, `.f03`, `.f08`.

The Fortran frontend rejects unsupported non-Fortran syntax before
wrapper-focused parsing when it appears outside executable procedure/program
bodies, which are intentionally not represented in the extracted interface.

The human-readable parse tree keeps scope variables compact by default as
`vars=N`. Add `--show-vars` to print the variables, or `--print-limit N` to
print only the first `N` items in each repeated section.

### 3.2 Human-readable output example

Input Fortran (`tests/data/fortran/general/basic_subroutine.f90`):

<!-- x2py-doc-source: tests/data/fortran/general/basic_subroutine.f90 -->
```fortran
module m1
contains
subroutine add1(n, x)
  integer, intent(in) :: n
  real(kind=8), intent(inout), dimension(n) :: x
end subroutine add1
end module m1
```

Command:

<!-- x2py-doc-test: exact -->
```bash
python -m x2py tests/data/fortran/general/basic_subroutine.f90 --parse
```

Expected output:

<!-- x2py-doc-test-output -->
```text
File: tests/data/fortran/general/basic_subroutine.f90
  Modules: 1
    - module m1 (vars=0, uses=0)
      Procedures: 1
        - subroutine add1(n:integer[0], x:real(8)[1])
```

The same command with `--show-vars` uses the variable-expanded report path.
This fixture currently has no module variables to print, so the output remains
compact:

<!-- x2py-doc-test: exact -->
```bash
python -m x2py tests/data/fortran/general/basic_subroutine.f90 --parse --show-vars
```

<!-- x2py-doc-test-output -->
```text
File: tests/data/fortran/general/basic_subroutine.f90
  Modules: 1
    - module m1 (vars=0, uses=0)
      Procedures: 1
        - subroutine add1(n:integer[0], x:real(8)[1])
```

For large files:

```bash
python -m x2py path/to/file.f90 --parse --show-vars --print-limit 50
```

`--print-limit` applies independently to modules, submodules, programs, block
data units, derived types, fields, procedures, and variables when variables are
shown. Counts such as `Procedures: 80` and `Variables: 657` still show the full
totals even when only the first `N` entries are printed.

Interpretation:

- Parsed entities are counted per file.
- Free procedures (outside modules) are shown in top-level `Procedures`.
- Module-contained procedures are nested under each module.
- Empty sections are omitted from the human-readable report.

More complex example:

Input Fortran (`mixed_example.f90`):

<!-- X2PY_C_DOCS_START
```fortran
subroutine driver(n)
  integer, intent(in) :: n
end subroutine driver

module math_ops
  use iso_c_binding, only: c_double
  implicit none
  real(c_double) :: alpha
contains
  subroutine saxpy(n, a, x, y)
    integer, intent(in) :: n
    real(c_double), intent(in) :: a
    real(c_double), dimension(n), intent(in) :: x
    real(c_double), dimension(n), intent(inout) :: y
  end subroutine saxpy

  function dot(x, y) result(r)
    real(c_double), dimension(:), intent(in) :: x, y
    real(c_double) :: r
  end function dot
end module math_ops

module io_ops
  implicit none
contains
  subroutine dump(v)
    real, dimension(:), intent(in) :: v
  end subroutine dump
end module io_ops
```
X2PY_C_DOCS_END -->

Command:

```bash
python -m x2py mixed_example.f90
```

```text
File: mixed_example.f90
  Procedures: 1
    - subroutine driver(n:integer[0])
  Modules: 2
    - module math_ops (vars=1, uses=1)
      Procedures: 2
        - subroutine saxpy(n:integer[0], a:real[0], x:real[1], y:real[1])
        - function dot(x:real[1], y:real[1])
    - module io_ops (vars=0, uses=0)
      Procedures: 1
        - subroutine dump(v:real[1])
```

### 3.3 JSON and semantic output

Print parser JSON:

```bash
python -m x2py tests/data/fortran/general/basic_subroutine.f90 --json
```

Write parser JSON:

```bash
python -m x2py tests/data/fortran/general/basic_subroutine.f90 --parse --json --out report.json
```

Expected JSON layout:

- Top-level object keyed by input path
- Per-file payload with keys:
  - `signatures`
  - `types`
  - `modules`
  - `submodules`
  - `programs`
  - `block_data`

When `x2py --parse --json` applies compiler preprocessing, the per-file payload
also contains `preprocessing_recipe`. The CLI applies compiler preprocessing
for file-based parsing; compiler linemarkers remain accepted for provenance.
The recipe records the exact compiler executable or adapter, argv, include
paths, macro flags, standard, extra compiler arguments, working directory,
include graph, source mappings, diagnostics, and optional macro metadata used
to produce the parsed stdout stream.

Fortran CPP directives are handled by the configured compiler. Native Fortran
`include "file.inc"` statements are then expanded recursively by the
preprocessing layer before the single parser pass. Native INCLUDE is textual
insertion into the current scope; it is not a `use` import from a separately
compiled module. Include lookup is relative to the including file first, then
the configured include directories, duplicate textual inclusion is preserved,
and missing files or cycles produce `INCLUDE_NOT_FOUND` or `INCLUDE_CYCLE`
diagnostics.

`use` import shape:

<!-- X2PY_C_DOCS_START
- A bare module import such as `use iso_c_binding` is serialized as an empty
  symbol list for that module.
- An explicit import such as `use iso_c_binding, only: c_int` is serialized as
  a list of mapping objects:
X2PY_C_DOCS_END -->

<!-- X2PY_C_DOCS_START
```json
"uses": {
  "iso_c_binding": [
    {
      "source": "c_int",
      "target": null
    }
  ]
}
```
X2PY_C_DOCS_END -->

- A renamed import such as
  `use list_input, delete_input => delete_input_list` records both sides:

```json
"uses": {
  "list_input": [
    {
      "source": "delete_input_list",
      "target": "delete_input"
    }
  ]
}
```

<!-- X2PY_C_DOCS_START
For compatibility in Python tests and simple consumers, `FortranUseMapping`
entries compare equal to their local name, so
`module.uses["iso_c_binding"] == ["c_int"]` remains true for direct equality
checks. Prefer reading `source`, `target`, or `local_name` in new code.
X2PY_C_DOCS_END -->

### 3.4 Wrap-readiness summary

```bash
python -m x2py tests/data/fortran/general/basic_subroutine.f90 --wrap-readiness
```

This mode parses the source, converts it to semantic IR, and prints the
per-file semantic readiness status. A non-wrappable file is reported as
`Wrappable: no` followed by a `Why not wrappable` section listing semantic
blockers, for example unresolved semantic types, missing compile-time constant
values, or incomplete callback signatures.

Parser output and readiness are separate stages. Run parser inspection with:

```bash
python -m x2py tests/data/fortran/general/basic_subroutine.f90 --parse
```

Run readiness inspection separately:

```bash
python -m x2py tests/data/fortran/general/basic_subroutine.f90 --wrap-readiness
```

Parser JSON stays parse-only.

Semantic IR JSON uses the same output channels, but the per-file payload is the
semantic model projection instead of raw parser output:

```bash
python -m x2py tests/data/fortran/general/basic_subroutine.f90 --semantics
```

Generated `.pyi` text is printed with:

```bash
python -m x2py tests/data/fortran/general/basic_subroutine.f90 --pyi
```

### 3.5 Parse-error diagnostics and debug mode

When parsing fails, the CLI prints a compiler-style diagnostic to `stderr` and
exits with status code `1`. By default this output is intended for end users: it
includes the source location, diagnostic code, message, source line, and caret
context, but it does **not** include a Python traceback.

Example command:

```bash
python -m x2py tests/data/fortran/errors/err_duplicate_argument_name.f90
```

Example diagnostic shape:

```text
tests/data/fortran/errors/err_duplicate_argument_name.f90:1:1: error[PARSE_DUPLICATE_ARGUMENT]: Duplicate argument name 'x' in procedure 'dup'.
  |
1 | subroutine dup(x, y, x)
  | ^
```

ANSI color is enabled by default when available; no color flag is needed for
normal use. To disable color explicitly, pass `--no-color` or set the standard
`NO_COLOR` environment variable:

```bash
python -m x2py bad.f90 --no-color
NO_COLOR=1 python -m x2py bad.f90
```

For parser development, use `--debug` to re-raise
`FortranParseError` and let Python print the full traceback showing where the
error was raised internally:

```bash
python -m x2py bad.f90 --debug
```

`--debug-traceback` remains accepted as a compatibility alias.

The same developer mode can be enabled with the environment variable
`FORTRAN_PARSER_DEBUG=1`:

```bash
FORTRAN_PARSER_DEBUG=1 python -m x2py bad.f90
```

In debug mode, the traceback's final exception message also includes a
`note: parser raised at ...` line with the internal parser file, line, and
function that created the diagnostic.

## 4) Python usage and expected outputs

### 4.1 Parse folder namespace

```python
from x2py import parse_fortran_project
from pathlib import Path

files = [str(p) for p in Path("tests/data/fortran/general").rglob("*.f90")][:5]
project = parse_fortran_project(files)
print(len(project.files))
print(len(project.modules))
```

Expected behavior:

- Recursively scans Fortran files.
- Resolves dependencies and module imports across files.
- Returns aggregate namespace parse output.

### 4.2 Parse single file and run semantic readiness check

```python
from pathlib import Path
from x2py import parse_fortran_file, assess_semantic_wrap_readiness
from semantics.fortran2ir import fortran_file_to_semantic_modules

p = Path("tests/data/fortran/general/basic_subroutine.f90")
code = p.read_text()

parsed = parse_fortran_file(code, filename=str(p))
modules = fortran_file_to_semantic_modules(parsed, standalone_module_name=p.stem)
readiness = assess_semantic_wrap_readiness(modules, source=str(p))

print("procedures", len(parsed.procedures))
print("wrappable", readiness["wrappable"])
print("blockers", len(readiness["wrappability_blockers"]))
```

Expected behavior:

- `parsed` is a `FortranFile` aggregate model with parsed units and symbols.
- `modules` is the semantic IR projection used by `.pyi` printing and
  readiness.
- `readiness` includes semantic API counts, semantic blockers, and the
  file-level `wrappable` flag.

### 4.3 Structured argument specifications

Compatibility fields such as `FortranArgument.shape`, `lbound`, `ubound`, and
`kind` remain serialized as strings/lists. For callers that need typed access,
argument and variable models also expose structured helpers:

- `structured_shape` returns a `FortranShape` containing parsed dimensions.
- Slice-like dimensions such as `1:n:2` are represented as `FortranSlice`.
- Whole-expression function calls such as `lbound(x, 1)` are represented as
  `FortranFunctionCall`.
- `kind_expression` and `value_expression` parse `kind` and `value` strings
  using the same lightweight expression model.

Example:

```python
arg.shape
# ["lbound(src, 2):ubound(src, 2)"]

dim = arg.structured_shape.dimensions[0]
dim.lower.name
# "lbound"
dim.upper.name
# "ubound"
```

## 5) Running tests

Run all tests:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q
```

Run parser-focused tests:

```bash
python -m x2py tests/data/fortran/general/basic_subroutine.f90 --language fortran --parse --json
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q tests/parsing/fortran/
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q tests/parsing/fortran/test_fortran_fixture_suite.py
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q tests/cli/
```

Focused test files by implementation area:

- Parser walkthrough and expected developer flow:
  `tests/parsing/fortran/test_developer_tutorial.py`
- Procedure headers, declarations, derived types, interfaces, and type-bound
  procedures:
  `tests/parsing/fortran/`
- Function header edge cases:
  `tests/parsing/fortran/test_function_headers.py`
- Scope handling and project namespace behavior:
  `tests/parsing/fortran/test_scope_handling.py` and
  `tests/parsing/fortran/test_project_scope_models.py`
- Preprocessing, native includes, and execution-boundary skipping:
  `tests/pipeline/preprocessing/test_parser_boundaries.py`
- Parser diagnostics and fatal error contracts:
  `tests/parsing/fortran/test_error_handling.py`
- Regression contracts:
  `tests/parsing/fortran/`
- Public entrypoints:
  `tests/parsing/fortran/test_public_entrypoints.py`
- Parser fixture goldens:
  `tests/parsing/fortran/test_fortran_fixture_suite.py`
- Parser error fixture goldens:
  `tests/parsing/fortran/test_error_fixture_suite.py`
- Parser JSON shape:
  `tests/parsing/fortran/test_json_sanity.py`
- Cached Fortran compiler/type and intrinsic-storage probing:
  `tests/probes/test_fortran_types.py`
- Shared CLI behavior:
  `tests/cli/`

When adding or changing a Fortran parser feature, add a focused parser test
near the implementation concern first, then update fixture goldens only when
the serialized parser contract intentionally changes.

Update golden JSON fixtures:

```bash
python tests/parser/fortran/generate_fortran_parser_goldens.py
```

Update selected fixture(s):

```bash
python tests/parser/fortran/generate_fortran_parser_goldens.py tests/data/fortran/general/basic_subroutine.f90
```

In-test auto-update mode:

```bash
FORTRAN_PARSER_UPDATE_GOLDENS=1 PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q tests/parsing/fortran/test_fortran_fixture_suite.py --confcutdir=tests/
```

Semantic and `.pyi` fixtures have separate generators:

```bash
python tests/semantics/generate_semantic_fixtures.py
python tests/pyi/generate_pyi_fixtures.py
```

## 6) Error handling

All parse failures raise `FortranParseError`, a subclass of `ValueError`. The
exception keeps structured metadata for consumers:

- `filename` — source path supplied to the parser, if any
- `line_number` — 1-based source line where the error was detected, if known
- `source_line` — original source text for context, if known
- `base_message` — stable error text without location/source context
- `code` — stable, explicit diagnostic category identifier; manually
  constructed fallback errors use `PARSE_ERROR`, while grammar rejection uses
  `PARSE_INVALID_SYNTAX`

Diagnostic codes are for programmatic matching in tests, tools, and
documentation. The category name states the failure class directly. The shared
registry is [`diagnostic-codes.md`](../user/reference/diagnostic-codes.md).

`str(error)` and `error.format_diagnostic(color=False)` render a
compiler-style diagnostic:

```text
<filename>:<line>:1: error[<CATEGORY>]: <message>
  |
<N> | <source line>
  | ^
```

If no filename is available, the location is rendered as `<unknown>`. If a line
number or source line is unavailable, that part of the diagnostic is omitted or
shown with `?` as appropriate. Use `error.base_message` when tests or API
consumers need only the message text.

`format_diagnostic(color=True)` adds ANSI styling. The CLI requests colored
diagnostics by default when available; pass `--no-color` or set `NO_COLOR=1` to
disable ANSI output. On Windows, ANSI console compatibility is enabled through
`colorama` when it is installed.

For parser development, `format_diagnostic(debug=True)` appends a note with the
internal parser file, line, and function that raised the error. The CLI exposes
this through `--debug`, its compatibility alias `--debug-traceback`, or
`FORTRAN_PARSER_DEBUG=1`; normal CLI parse errors intentionally hide Python
tracebacks.

The sections below list each error category, the triggering condition, and the
exact `base_message` format (with `<...>` placeholders for runtime values).

### 6.1 Unknown or unsupported type declaration

Triggered when a declaration line cannot be matched to any known intrinsic type,
`type(...)`, or `character` variant.

**In a procedure:**

```
Unknown or unsupported datatype declaration for procedure '<name>': <line>
```

Example Fortran that triggers this:

```fortran
subroutine bad(x)
  weirdtype :: x
end subroutine bad
```

Example error:

```
bad.f90:2:1: error[PARSE_UNSUPPORTED_DECLARATION]: Unknown or unsupported datatype declaration for procedure 'bad': weirdtype :: x
  |
2 |   weirdtype :: x
  | ^
```

**In a derived type:**

```
Unknown or unsupported datatype declaration in type '<name>': <line>
```

**In a module:**

```
Unknown or unsupported datatype declaration in module '<name>': <line>
```

### 6.2 Duplicate declaration

Triggered when the same symbol is declared more than once in the same scope.

**In a procedure (arguments and local declarations):**

```
Duplicate declaration of symbol '<name>' in procedure '<proc>'.
```

Example:

```fortran
subroutine dup(x)
  real :: x
  integer :: x
end subroutine dup
```

Example error:

```
dup.f90:3:1: error[PARSE_DUPLICATE_DECLARATION]: Duplicate declaration of symbol 'x' in procedure 'dup'.
  |
3 |   integer :: x
  | ^
```

**PARAMETER constants:**

```
Duplicate PARAMETER declaration of symbol '<name>' in procedure '<proc>'.
```

**In a derived type:**

```
Duplicate field '<name>' in derived type '<type>'.
```

**In a module:**

```
Duplicate variable '<name>' in module '<module>'.
```

### 6.3 Duplicate procedure name

Triggered when the same procedure name appears more than once within the same
module or global scope.
Internal procedures inside separate host `contains` blocks are scoped to their
host and do **not** conflict with each other.

**Global scope:**

```
Duplicate procedure name '<name>' in global scope.
```

**Module scope:**

```
Duplicate procedure name '<name>' in module '<module>'.
```

Example:

```fortran
subroutine work(n)
  integer, intent(in) :: n
end subroutine work

subroutine work(n)
  integer, intent(in) :: n
end subroutine work
```

Example error:

```
dup.f90:5:1: error[PARSE_DUPLICATE_PROCEDURE]: Duplicate procedure name 'work' in global scope.
  |
5 | subroutine work(n)
  | ^
```

### 6.4 Duplicate argument name

Triggered when a procedure's argument list contains the same name more than once.

```
Duplicate argument name '<name>' in procedure '<proc>'.
```

Example:

```fortran
subroutine dup(x, y, x)
  integer, intent(in) :: x
  real, intent(in) :: y
end subroutine dup
```

Example error:

```
dup_arg.f90:1:1: error[PARSE_DUPLICATE_ARGUMENT]: Duplicate argument name 'x' in procedure 'dup'.
  |
1 | subroutine dup(x, y, x)
  | ^
```

### 6.5 Star-kind declarations

Legacy `type*N` declarations, such as `real*8`, are accepted in both fixed-form
and modern-extension files. Numeric star declarations preserve their fixed
total storage width for semantic conversion. This matters most for complex
types: `complex*8` is an 8-byte `Complex64`, while modern `complex(kind=8)` is
a compiler kind and is 16 bytes on the documented `gfortran` target.
`DOUBLE PRECISION` and `DOUBLE COMPLEX` retain a compiler-dependent double-kind
expression and use the cached Fortran type probe. For `CHARACTER*N` and
`CHARACTER*(*)`, the star value is a length, not a kind or element storage
width.

```fortran
subroutine accepted(x)
  real*8 :: x
end subroutine accepted
```

See the [generated modern and legacy datatype mapping](../user/reference/semantic-ir.md#generated-linux-x86_64-mapping-example)
for the exact GitHub Actions target results.

### 6.6 Source-form metadata

The parser records source-form metadata from the filename and lexer, but does
not reject a construct solely because a `.f77` suffix was used. Grammar-region
validation still applies after preprocessing.

### 6.7 Implicit none — undeclared argument or result

Triggered when `implicit none` is active and an argument (or function result)
has no matching type declaration.

**Argument:**

```
Argument '<name>' in procedure '<proc>' has no type declaration (implicit none is active).
```

**Function result:**

```
Function result '<name>' in procedure '<proc>' has no type declaration (implicit none is active).
```

Example:

```fortran
subroutine foo(x, y)
  implicit none
  integer, intent(in) :: x
end subroutine foo
```

Example error:

```
implicit_none.f90:1:1: error[PARSE_IMPLICIT_NONE_UNDECLARED_SYMBOL]: Argument 'y' in procedure 'foo' has no type declaration (implicit none is active).
  |
1 | subroutine foo(x, y)
  | ^
```

### 6.8 Unknown datatype for function result

Triggered when a function result has no resolvable type after parsing (and
`implicit none` prevents implicit typing).

```
Unknown datatype for function result '<name>' in procedure '<proc>'.
```

Example:

```fortran
function f(x) result(res)
  implicit none
  real :: x
end function f
```

Example error:

```
bad.f90:1:1: error[PARSE_UNKNOWN_FUNCTION_RESULT_TYPE]: Unknown datatype for function result 'res' in procedure 'f'.
  |
1 | function f(x) result(res)
  | ^
```

### 6.9 Unknown datatype for a module variable

Triggered by `_validate_module_variables` when a parsed module variable still
has `base_type == "unknown"` after declaration parsing.

```
Unknown type for variable '<name>' in module '<module>'.
```

### 6.10 Unknown datatype for a derived type field

Triggered by `_validate_derived_type_fields` when a field still has
`base_type == "unknown"`.

```
Unknown type for field '<name>' in derived type '<type>'.
```

### 6.11 PARAMETER symbol without type in `implicit none` scope

Triggered when a legacy `PARAMETER (...)` statement names a symbol that has not
been typed and `implicit none` is in effect.

```
Unknown datatype for PARAMETER symbol '<name>' in procedure '<proc>'.
```

Example:

```fortran
      subroutine cst(a)
      implicit none
      real a
      parameter ( zero = 0.0e+0 )
      end
```

Example error:

```
legacy.f:4:1: error[PARSE_UNKNOWN_PARAMETER_TYPE]: Unknown datatype for PARAMETER symbol 'zero' in procedure 'cst'.
  |
4 |       parameter ( zero = 0.0e+0 )
  | ^
```

### 6.12 Function result variable shadows an argument

Triggered when a `result(name)` clause reuses an argument name (and the two
names are different from each other — the special case `result(f)` on a
function named `f` is allowed).

```
Function result variable '<result>' in function '<func>' shadows an argument name.
```

Example:

```fortran
function f(res) result(res)
  integer, intent(in) :: res
end function f
```

Example error:

```
shadow.f90:1:1: error[PARSE_RESULT_SHADOWS_ARGUMENT]: Function result variable 'res' in function 'f' shadows an argument name.
  |
1 | function f(res) result(res)
  | ^
```

### 6.13 Failed to resolve declared argument

An internal safety check: if a symbol was explicitly declared but its type
could not be applied (a parser regression guard), the following error is raised.

```
Failed to resolve declared argument '<name>' in procedure '<proc>'.
```

## 7) Scope note

This parser is intentionally wrapper-focused and not a complete Fortran front
end. Unsupported syntax should be surfaced through parser diagnostics or later
semantic readiness output for incremental parser extension.


### External callback dummy declarations

The parser accepts legacy callback-style declarations inside procedure scopes, including:

- `external :: cb` (treated as a procedure-typed dummy)
- `real, external :: f` / `integer, external :: g` (typed external function dummies)

Under `implicit none`, these declarations count as valid argument declarations, so callback arguments are not reported as missing datatype declarations.

## 8) File, project, and semantic entrypoints

Use the stable top-level API:

- `parse_fortran_file(source_or_path, filename=None, encoding="utf-8") -> FortranFile`
- `parse_fortran_project(files, encoding="utf-8") -> FortranProject`
- `assess_semantic_wrap_readiness(semantic_ir, source=None) -> dict`
- `assess_pyi_wrap_readiness(path_or_paths, encoding="utf-8") -> dict`

Lower-level unit parsers are internal `FortranParser` methods.

Semantic conversion lives in `x2py/semantics/fortran2ir.py`. It accepts parsed `FortranFile`
(or selected `FortranModule`) structures and converts metadata into semantic IR
consumed by the `.pyi` printer and current Fortran wrapper/runtime stages.
Compiler-backed shared-CLI semantic stages resolve compiler-dependent kind
expressions, measure intrinsic storage with `storage_size`, attach those facts
to semantic types, and reuse memory and persistent caches. For the maintained
GitHub Actions `gfortran` profile, unqualified `integer`, `real`, and `complex`
map to `Int32`, `Float32`, and `Complex64`; target-changing flags can change
those mappings. The
[generated target datatype mapping](../user/reference/semantic-ir.md#generated-linux-x86_64-mapping-example)
measures and verifies those storage facts.

The Fortran probe cache key includes the generated expression source, resolved
compiler binary identity, target flags, includes, macros, requested standard,
working directory, target-related environment, and runner. The persistent
location is `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/x2py/fortran_type_probe` or
`~/.cache/x2py/fortran_type_probe`; `X2PY_CACHE_DIR`,
`--fortran-type-probe-cache-dir`, and standalone `--cache-dir` override it.
Use `--refresh-fortran-type-probe` or standalone `--refresh` after an external
compiler/sysroot change that does not alter the cache key.

The standalone probe can create a reusable report containing the exact
compile-time and storage expressions needed by a source:

```bash
python3 -m x2py.probes.fortran_types --compiler gfortran \
  --expr='selected_real_kind(12)' \
  --expr='storage_size(real(0.0,kind=8))' \
  > build/fortran-types.json
```

Pass that report with `--fortran-type-report` when automatic direct-compiler
probing is not appropriate. A missing required expression is reported
explicitly instead of falling back to an unrelated target mapping.

The semantic converter also supports compile-time specialization for values the
parser intentionally leaves symbolic. Use
`collect_semantic_compile_time_requirements(parsed)` to list missing parameter
or kind values, then pass a dictionary such as
`{"selected_real_kind(12)": 8}` to
`fortran_module_to_semantic_module(..., compile_time_values=...)` or
`fortran_file_to_semantic_modules(..., compile_time_values=...)`. Existing
semantic IR can be copied and specialized with
`resolve_semantic_compile_time_values(module, {"n": 64})`.
