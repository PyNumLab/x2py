## Contributing

### Pull requests

- **CI must be green before merging**: do not merge a PR unless all checks pass (including `test` and `parser-reference-guard`).
- **Explain fixture/golden updates**: if you update any JSON under `tests/data/fortran/` or `tests/parser/fortran/fixtures/`, include a short note in the PR describing why the expected output changed.
- **Run the QA stack for parser/compiler changes**: install `python -m pip install -e ".[qa]"`, use the workflows in `docs/quality.md`, and update that file when a staged adoption task or scheduled triage item changes.

### Parser reference guard

This repo includes a CI guard that may require updating parser reference docs
when parser-related files change.

- **C parser changes**: if you change `x2py/parsers/c/`, `tests/parser/c/`, or
  `tests/data/c/`, update `docs/c_parser.md` when the change affects the
  documented feature inventory, public API, diagnostics, fixtures, semantic
  handoff, or maintenance workflow. The guard also treats
  `tests/probes/test_c_types.py` as C parser related.
- **Fortran parser changes**: if you change `x2py/parsers/fortran/`,
  `tests/parser/fortran/`, or `tests/data/fortran/`, update
  `docs/fortran_parser.md` when the change affects the documented feature
  inventory, public API, diagnostics, fixtures, semantic handoff, or
  maintenance workflow. The guard also tracks focused Fortran parser tests
  directly under `tests/parser/`.
- **Shared parser workflow changes**: if you change shared parser CLI or
  preprocessing behavior, update `docs/c_parser.md` or
  `docs/fortran_parser.md`, whichever parser behavior changed.
- **Bypass (use sparingly)**: add the PR label `ignore-parser-reference-guard` to skip that guard for changes that do not meaningfully affect the reference.
